<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="center">THIS BOOK IS PRESENTED
WITH THE
COMPLIMENTS OF THE AUTHOR</p>

<p class="center">To a Few Selected Leaders of American Thought
and Shapers of Public Opinion</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader:</span></p>

<p>I send you this book in the hope that if not already
convinced, you will be convinced by it of the
defenseless state of this country&mdash;convinced that
our danger is as great as our weakness. I hope
that you may be moved to use your influence that
this country may, by adequate preparation
against war, safeguard the property, honor and
lives of its people and the sanctity of the American
home from violation by a foreign foe.</p>

<p>If you are already convinced of our great need
then the reading of this book may still strengthen
your conviction and stimulate your efforts in the
cause of national defense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>After you have read the book, kindly lend it to
your friends, that they also may read it.</p>

<p>Defenseless America was published a year ago
at two dollars per copy. Several editions of the
book have already been printed and sold.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of the work I presented
ten thousand copies, with my compliments,
to students graduating in American universities.
This has given many persons the impression that
Defenseless America is a book for free distribution.</p>

<p>To correct such an impression, let me say most
emphatically that this book is not free, except to
a few persons whom I have selected, and to whom
I have sent it free at my own personal expense,
for the good of the cause of national defense.</p>

<p>The book has exerted so marked an influence
in rousing the people of this country to their
needs for defense against the red hell of war, that
the publishers, through patriotic duty, have
placed the good it is doing above all considerations
of profit to themselves, and have supplied
me copies of this edition of the work absolutely at
cost.</p>

<p>The publishers have also put an edition of the
book on sale, of which this copy is a specimen, at
only fifty cents a copy. In order to enable them
to do this, I have cut out all royalties on sales
which they may make.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>This edition of the book may be bought of or
ordered through any book store at fifty cents a
copy, or from the publishers, Hearst's International
Library Company, 119 West 40th Street,
New York, N. Y., who will send single copies of
the book to any address on receipt of sixty cents,
or they will send ten copies of the book, in a single
package, to any address on receipt of five dollars&mdash;fifty
cents a copy.</p>

<p>Copies of the regular library edition, printed on
superior paper and bound in extra cloth, gold
stamping, may be obtained from booksellers or
direct from the publishers at two dollars a copy.</p>

<p>Many of the readers of this book have already
seen that wonderful motion picture play, "The
Battle Cry of Peace," founded upon it.</p>

<p>Commodore J. Stuart Blackton, President of
the Vitagraph Company of America, who wrote
the scenario of "The Battle Cry of Peace", has
this to say about Defenseless America:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"To the fearless patriotism of Hudson
Maxim and the plain, practical, straightforward
truths in his book, 'Defenseless America,'
I owe the inspiration and impetus which
caused me to conceive and write the scenario
of 'The Battle Cry of Peace.'</p>

<p>"The object of both book and picture is to
arouse in the heart of every American citizen
a sense of his strict accountability to his
government in time of need, and to bring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the notice of the greatest number of people
in the shortest possible time the fact that
there is a way to insure that peace for which
we all so earnestly pray."</p></blockquote>

<p>Commodore Blackton, being a staunch patriot
and a man with phenomenal vision and breadth of
understanding, and being one of the largest producers
of motion pictures in the world, saw at
once, as soon as he read Defenseless America,
that the best way to impress the American people
with the message of the book, as he had himself
been impressed by reading it, was to visualize
that message in a great motion picture. Then the
people would be able to see, with their own eyes,
those terrible things happening in our country
and in our very homes, which are happening
abroad and which are surely going to happen to
us if we do not prepare, and immediately and
adequately prepare to save the country.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The main object of this book is to present
a phalanx of facts upon the subject of the
defenseless condition of this country, and
to show what must be done, and done quickly, in
order to avert the most dire calamity that can fall
upon a people&mdash;that of merciless invasion by a
foreign foe, with the horrors of which no pestilence
can be compared.</p>

<p>We should bring a lesser calamity upon ourselves
by abolishing our quarantine system against
the importation of deadly disease and inviting
a visitation like the great London Plague, or by
letting in the Black Death to sweep our country
as it swept Europe in the Middle Ages, than by
neglecting our quarantine against war, as we are
neglecting it, thereby inviting the pestilence of
invasion.</p>

<p>Self-preservation is the first law of Nature, and
this law applies to nations exactly as it applies
to individuals. Our American Republic cannot
survive unless it obeys the law of survival, which
all individuals must obey, which all nations must
obey, and which all other nations are obeying.
No individual, and no nation, has ever disobeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
that law for long and lived; and it is too big a task
for the United States of America.</p>

<p>It is the aim of this work to discover truth to
the reader, unvarnished and unembellished, and,
at the same time, as far as possible, to avoid personalities.
Wherever practicable, philosophic
generalizations have been tied down to actualities,
based upon experiential knowledge and
innate common-sense of the eternal fitness of
things.</p>

<p>The strong appeal of Lord Roberts for the
British nation to prepare for the Armageddon
that is now on, which he knew was coming, did
not awaken England, but served rather to rouse
Germany.</p>

<p>Admiral Mahan pleaded long with his country
for an adequate navy. All the Great Powers of the
world except America were stimulated by his logic
to strengthen their navies. The beautiful, imaginative,
logical language of General Homer Lea,
on America's military weakness, in his "Valor
of Ignorance" and "The Day of the Saxon," has
caused many a gun to be made, many a battalion
of troops to be enlisted, and many a warship to
be built&mdash;in foreign countries.</p>

<p>The eloquent words of wisdom of Lord Roberts,
Admiral Mahan, Homer Lea, and all real friends
of peace and advocates of the only way of maintaining
peace&mdash;by being prepared against war&mdash;have
fallen on a deaf America. I am well aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of the fact that nothing I can say will rouse the
people of my country to the reality and magnitude
of their danger, and to a true appreciation
of the imperative necessity for immediate preparation
against war.</p>

<p>Possibly this book may lessen a little the effect
of the pernicious propagandism of the pacifists&mdash;may
somewhat help Congressional appropriations
for defense&mdash;may place a few more men and a
few more guns on the firing-line, and thereby save
the lives of a few of our people&mdash;may save a few
homes from the torch&mdash;may lessen the area of
devastation&mdash;may, by adding a little power to our
resistance, help to get slightly better terms from
the conquerors for our liberation.</p>

<p>Pacifism has ringed the nose of the American
people and is leading them, blind and unknowing,
to the slaughter. War is inevitable. It matters
not that, if this country could be roused, it might
be saved. When it is impossible to vitalize the
impulse necessary to the accomplishment of a
thing, that thing is impossible. So, I say, war is
inevitable and imminent.</p>

<p>The American people could not now be roused
sufficiently to avert the impending calamity even
by a call that would rift the sky and shake down
the stars from heaven!</p>

<p>Fate has decreed that our pride shall be humbled,
and that we shall be bowed to the dirt. We
must first put on sackcloth, ashed in the embers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of our burning homes. Perhaps, when we build
anew on the fire-blackened desolation, our mood
may be receptive of the knowledge that we must
shield our homes with blood and brawn and
iron.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>OUR GREAT OBSESSION</h3>


<p>Success in every human pursuit depends
upon ability to discern the truth and to
utilize it. Facts, though they may be stern,
are our best friends, and we should always welcome
them with an open mind.</p>

<p>Napoleon said that with good news there is
never any hurry, but with bad news not a moment
is to be lost. Consequently, those who discover
to us certain facts of serious concern are our
friends, even though it may be bad news. It is
every man's duty, not only to himself, but also to
those dear to him, to know the truth about anything
which may menace his and their welfare,
in order that he and they may become awakened
to the danger and prepare for it accordingly.</p>

<p>Those who deceive us by warning us of danger
when there is no danger may not do us any harm;
in fact, they may even do us good by cultivating
our alertness and awareness. The hare may
jump at a thousand false alarms to every one of
actual danger; but it is the false alarms that
have given him the alertness to save himself when
real danger comes. On the other hand, those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
convince us that there is no danger when there
is great danger are the worst of enemies; they
expose us, naked of defense, to the armed and
armored enemy.</p>

<p>Among the great deceivers with whom the human
race has to contend is the confidence man,
for he plays upon the fears, vanity, and credulity
of his victim with the skill of a Kubelik upon the
violin. He enlists his victim with him, and they
work together to the same end. No man is greatly
deceived by another except through his own co-operation.
Every one has his pet egoistic illusion
always under the spotlight of self-view; to
him, his own importance is a veritable obsession.</p>

<p>A nation is only a compound of individuals, and
what is true of an individual also holds true of
any aggregation of individuals.</p>

<p>We, the people of the United States of America,
are at this moment, and have been for many years,
afflicted with a dominating egoistic obsession concerning
our greatness, our importance, and our
power, while we correspondingly underrate the
greatness, the importance, and the power of other
nations and races. Our accomplishments have indeed
been marvelous, and we have not neglected
to award them all the marveling that is their due.</p>

<p>There is no denying the fact that in many
competitive pursuits requiring intellectual acuteness
for the greatening of material welfare we
have outstripped the rest of the world. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
rest of the world has been busy, too, and though
we may possibly deserve more credit for our accomplishments
in the aggregate than any other
people, still, others have far outdone us in many
important respects.</p>

<p>Our hitherto isolated and unassailable geographical
position has enabled us to utilize our
unequaled resources to become the greatest industrial
and the wealthiest people in the world.</p>

<p>We have not been obliged to concern ourselves
very much thus far with measures for national
security, and having at home all the land we
needed, we have acquired the habit of looking
upon national armaments in the light of frills,
which we must maintain merely for national respectability.
Many of us look upon our Navy
as dress-parade paraphernalia, to be worn on
gala occasions.</p>

<p>Our response to the advocacy of a sufficient
navy, of coast fortifications, and of a standing
army adequate to our needs, has been that we
have no use for either army or navy, and that
coast fortifications would be a useless expense.</p>

<p>Our enormous wealth and inexhaustible resources
have been and still are pointed out as
reasons why we require no armaments, although,
as a matter of fact, they are the strongest possible
reasons for armaments of a magnitude proportionate
to that wealth and those resources.</p>

<p>In America, we pride ourselves upon our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>so-called
free institutions, blindly believing that they
are free, and that, therefore, every man being an
aristocrat, we, by consequence, have no aristocracy,
entirely oblivious to the fact that we have
merely substituted the esteem of wealth, and the
power and the privilege which it represents, for
the esteem of family worth and family name, and
the power and the privilege which they represent.</p>

<p>Isolation and wealth beget vanity and arrogance;
and vanity, resting upon the laurels of
past accomplishments, rapidly fosters decadence
and weakness; so that the very pride of strength
and virility begets weakness and effeminacy.</p>

<p>It has been said that usually there are but three
generations between shirt-sleeves and shirt-sleeves.
The old man trades upon the name made
in the days of his younger strength, and the son,
seldom possessing the strength of the father,
trades on the father's name, while the third generation
generally gets back to shirt-sleeves again.
Although this statement is not a general truth, it
has truth enough to excuse it.</p>

<p>The main reason why luxury and opulence lead
to degeneracy, weakness, and effeminacy, is that
those who live on Easy Street, being relieved of
the intense strife necessary to gain a livelihood
and to climb to positions of opulence and power,
suffer from weakness and decay, and finally find
their way down to shirt-sleeves, at the foot of the
economic and social ladder, either to be sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>merged
in hoboism, or to make the climb of old
progenitors over again.</p>

<p>What is true of individuals and families in this
respect holds true also of nations, only it takes
a little longer time, starting from shirt-sleeves, to
get back to shirt-sleeves again.</p>

<p>We Americans were taught by the promoters
of the American Revolution&mdash;in short, by the fathers
of our country&mdash;that all men are created
equal in respect to privilege, and that no class
distinction and no class privilege were worthy of
honor unless earned. By consequence, the symbol
and the badge of our class distinction became
the dollar.</p>

<p>Taught to despise aristocracy, we immediately
created for ourselves a new aristocracy in the
shape of a plutocracy. This aristocracy of wealth
was fast becoming as tyrannical and unbearable
and as much a menace to the freedom of the people
as the old aristocracy which it had replaced.
The old aristocracy had been established by the
right of the sword; the new aristocracy had been
established by the purchasing power of the dollar,
and the people learned that combinations of
wealth were a compelling power as great as the
combination of armies, and that a government
dominated by the dollar might become as intolerable
as any form of absolutism.</p>

<p>Then there came another American revolution,
led by the labor unions, which proved that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
only necessary for the people to organize, in order
to conquer with the short-sword of the ballot as
effectually as with the sword of steel.</p>

<p>Unhappily, just as intolerance and avarice have
always led conquerors to be overgrasping and
tyrannical, so have intolerance and avarice made
prosecutions under the Sherman Law veritable
persecutions. Now that the common people have
found their power, nothing under heaven can halt
them, or prevent them from abusing that power,
except a higher education of the common people
and their leaders, compelling them to understand
the great truth that the people of a nation must
co-operate with a patriotism that shall emulate
the spirit of the hive of bees so admirably interpreted
by Maeterlinck.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must remember that, while we
may with advantage imitate the bee in this respect,
the bee does not progress. There has been
no enlightenment in bee-life for a hundred thousand
years, for the very reason that the bees
are dominated by that beautiful spirit of the
hive.</p>

<p>We owe our ability to progress and to become
more and more highly intelligent and enlightened,
to the existence of that instability and heterogeneity
which stimulate and develop us by causing us
to strive for stability and homogeneity.</p>

<p>Life is a series of reactions between the individual
and environing stimuli. For this reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
stern and exacting stimuli are required to develop
a man to the full. In all the ages during
which the race has been developing there have
existed formative influences of the sternest and
most exacting kind; so that, just as our ears are
constituted to hear only a certain character of
sounds, and sounds of a limited pitch, duration,
and loudness, and are deaf to all other sounds,
so are we constituted to react only to certain
environing stimuli, and to react with each stimulus
in a certain definite measure, and only in a certain
definite measure. It is impossible for us to
react supremely, or to be developed supremely,
by mediocre stimuli, but we must have supreme
stimuli, and in order to get those stimuli, there
must be a prompting to activity that demands of
a man every ounce of his strength; and everything
that is dear to him must be staked to bring
out and develop all the latent, larger energies
that are in him.</p>

<p>Nothing that can be said and done by all the
friends of national defense will make this country
take adequate measures for its defense. Nothing
but a disastrous war will supply the necessary
stimulus. In all the history of the world, this
truth has been made manifest&mdash;that no nation
can be made adequately to prepare against war,
no matter what the menace may be, without either
suffering actual defeat, or being so embroiled in
war as to realize the necessity for preparedness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>This country must first be whipped in order to
prepare sufficiently to prevent being whipped.
Therefore, our business at the present time is to
pick our conquerors. I choose England. I would
much rather see the red-coat in the streets of New
York than the spiked helmet. I would much
rather see the genial face of the British Tommy
Atkins than the stern mystery of the Japanese
face.</p>

<p>If England does not give us a good, timely
whipping, we are going to be whipped by Germany
or Japan, and the humiliation will be more
than is really needed to stimulate us for adequate
preparation.</p>

<p>When the present war is over, the precipitation
of a war with England may not depend on what
England will choose to do, but it may depend on
what we shall choose to do. We have been a lamb
rampant for a long time in a jungle alive with
lions, and we have owed our security to the fact
that the lions have been watching one another,
and have not dared to avert their eyes long enough
to devour us. If we did not have a grandiose
sense of our importance and power, we should not
need a whipping in order to prepare against war,
but so long as we believe that we can beat all
creation without any preparation, we are going
to act just as though it were true, and England,
although she may be friendly, may be forced, by
our inconsiderate bluff and arrogance, to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
war on us. Much better England than any other
country. England now has no territorial aspirations
that would make her want to annex some of
our land. She would be satisfied with a good big
indemnity, which we could well afford to pay for
the benefit we should gain from the war. If England
will merely come over seas, and whip us, and
tax us for the trouble, and thereby lead us to prepare
adequately to defend ourselves against less
friendly nations, she will do us the greatest possible
good.</p>

<p>We are living and working not alone for ourselves,
but also for those who are our own, and for
all others insomuch as their interests and their
welfare are in common with our own.</p>

<p>Our welfare is part and parcel of the aggregate
welfare of all those for whom we are working, and
our welfare and their welfare are not only a condition
of the present, but are also a condition of
the future. The welfare of our children and our
children's children, and of those whose interests
will be in common with theirs, is part and parcel
of our own present welfare. This is the true
philosophy by which we who are sane and conscientious
are guided. Upon such philosophy are
based all economics and all prudence.</p>

<p>The false philosophy of the selfish and the sensual,
the spendthrift and the debauchee, is the
philosophy of such as they whose acts of omission
and commission brought on the French Revolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>tion,
and who said, "<i>Après nous le déluge</i>"; but
such should not be our philosophy.</p>

<p>Therefore, if now there be a calamity in the
making, which we are able to foresee must surely
descend upon the heads of our children, even if it
does not come soon enough to fall upon our own
heads, it is a thing that should awaken our concern
and stimulate our inquiry, and lead us to
seek ways and means for averting it.</p>

<p>It is a fact, which I absolutely know as certainly
as anything can be known in human affairs,
that we, and all of those who are near and dear
to us, are sitting today on a powder magazine
with the train lighted, and it is only a question
of the slowness, or quickness, of the fuse when the
time shall arrive for the explosion.</p>

<p>The laws that govern human events are as
mathematically accurate and as immutable as the
laws that govern the motions of the heavenly
bodies; the laws that govern human reactions&mdash;the
reactions between men and men, communities
and communities, nations and nations&mdash;are as immutable
and are governed as exactly by the laws
of cause and effect as are chemical reactions.
Nothing can happen without a cause, and there
can be no cause that does not make something
happen. Every event is the child of its parents&mdash;cause
and effect.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the parentage of the cause
and effect whose progeny are soon to bring upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
us the great red peril of war, and, finding us unprepared,
will treat us as Germany has treated
Belgium. We are rich&mdash;our country from one
end to the other possesses a vast wealth of enticements
to the invasion of a foreign foe&mdash;and we
are defenseless. These conditions are the parents
of vast impending calamities.</p>

<p>Europe, today, is involved in the greatest war in
the history of mankind, and&mdash;in spite of all the
saving grace of our so-called modern civilization,
in spite of all the mercifulness of the Christian
religion, in spite of all the charitable kindness of
the Red Cross&mdash;the sum of brutality, savagery,
and misery of this war is certainly not much less
than it has been at any other time in the history
of a striving world, every page of which has
been written with blood.</p>

<p>We have arrived at a time when we must decide
whether or not our safety can be better secured
and peace maintained with armaments or without
armaments.</p>

<h3>DANGEROUS PREACHMENTS</h3>

<blockquote><p>"There will be no war in the future, for it has become impossible
now that it is clear that war means suicide."</p>

<p>
<i>I. S. Bloch, "The Future of War," 1899.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"What shall we say of the Great War of Europe ever threatening,
ever impending, and which never comes? We shall say that
it will never come. Humanly speaking, it is impossible."</p>

<p>
<i>Dr. David Starr Jordan, "War and Waste," 1913.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>They who are loudest in their vociferations
about the calamities that the warring nations
of Europe have brought upon themselves
are those peace-palavering persons who
have been telling us all along, during the past
twenty-five years, that human nature had improved
so much lately, and the spirit of international
brotherhood had become so dominant, that
the fighting spirit was nearly dead in the souls of
men.</p>

<p>The peace praters have assured us from time
to time that the last great war of the world had
been fought; they have told us that no great nations
would dare to go to war any more, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
war between any of the Great Powers would now
mean bankruptcy and national suicide; they have
assured us that all international differences
would hereafter be settled by jurisprudential procedure,
and that law would be substituted for
war.</p>

<p>About fifteen years ago, a M. de Bloch
"proved" in his book, entitled "The Future of
War. Is War Now Possible?" that war had become
so deadly and destructive, and, above all, so
expensive, as to be impossible. So impressed was
the Czar of Russia with de Bloch's arguments that
he called a conference of the nations to consider
disarmament. Since that time a thousand different
persons have, in a thousand different ways,
"proved" to us that war on a large scale was not
only impossible, but also absolutely unthinkable.
Droll, isn't it, that the nations keep right on fighting?
We are consoled, however, by the insistence
of the peace prophets that this war is truly the
last great war. We are assured that this war
will be the death of militarism, and then the lamb
can safely cuddle up to the lion. Consequently,
we have been told that, war on a large scale being
now impossible, the United States needs no army
and no navy, and that it would be folly to waste the
taxpayers' money on such useless things.</p>

<p>Many believe that this country should set the
other nations of the world a great moral example
by pulling the teeth of our dogs of war, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
them lambs, and inviting the lions to lie down
with them, unheedful of the lesson of all ages
that when the lion does lie down with the lamb, the
lamb is always inside the lion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have been assured that the
mere possession of armaments leads a nation to
wage war, because being able to fight makes one
want to fight; and that, obviously, the best way to
avoid a fight is to be unable to fight.</p>

<p>I quote the following from Theodore Roosevelt's
book, "America and the World War":&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>These peace people have persistently and
resolutely blinked facts. One of the peace congresses
sat in New York at the very time that the
feeling in California about the Japanese question
gravely threatened the good relations between
ourselves and the great empire of Japan. The
only thing which at the moment could practically
be done for the cause of peace was to secure some
proper solution of the question at issue between
ourselves and Japan. But this represented real
effort, real thought. The peace congress paid
not the slightest serious attention to the matter
and instead devoted itself to listening to speeches
which favored the abolition of the United States
navy and even in one case the prohibiting the use
of tin soldiers in nurseries because of the militaristic
effect on the minds of the little boys and
girls who played with them!</i>"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>When the prophet Isaiah told the Jews that
there were big troubles brewing for them in the
East, he spoke to unhearing ears, because unwilling
ears. There were in those days, as
in our day, the false prophets of peace who
said that Isaiah was wrong; that there was no
cause for worry about the indignation of Jehovah;
that even at the worst His wrath could be appeased
at any time, as necessity might arise, by
a few burnt offerings and sacrificial mumblings.
Their assurances were more pleasing than the
warnings of Isaiah, so the Jews listened to the
false prophets instead of to Isaiah, and they paid
the penalty in Babylonian bondage.</p>

<p>The Isaiahs of true prophecy have long warned
the people of this country that there is big trouble
brewing for us in the East and in the Far
East, and that we need armaments and men
trained to arms to safeguard us against that
trouble. These Isaiahs have told us that we cannot
safeguard ourselves by any sacrifices made
upon the altar of international brotherhood, or
forefend ourselves against the great red peril of
war by a few mumblings written down in arbitration
treaties; but that we must have guns and men
behind the guns. The Isaiahs who have been
telling us these things are our true peace-advocates.</p>

<p>Those self-styled peace-men who are telling us
that the best way to avoid war is to be unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
defend ourselves are not peace-men, but war-breeders.
Though they emulate the dove in their
cooing, they are far from being doves of peace.
They ought to be styled dubs of peace. Their intentions
may be good, yet they are enemies of
peace, and betrayers of their country. Those who
prevent the building of coast fortifications, which
are our modern city gates, by advising against
them, betray their country as actually as those
who opened the gates of Rome to the hordes of
Alaric.</p>

<p>Those who are trying to defeat our Congressional
appropriations for a larger navy, for an
adequate army, and for sufficient coast fortifications,
although they may mean well, are as truly
enemies of their country as if they should, in war,
contribute to the armament and fighting force of
an enemy, for the effect in both cases is identical.</p>

<p>Again I quote from Mr. Roosevelt:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>We object to the actions of those who do most
talking about the necessity of peace because we
think they are really a menace to the just and
honorable peace which alone this country will in
the long run support. We object to their actions
because we believe they represent a course of conduct
which may at any time produce a war in
which we and not they would labor and suffer.</i></p>

<p>"<i>In such a war the prime fact to be remembered
is that the men really responsible for it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be those who would pay the penalty. The ultra-pacifists
are rarely men who go to battle. Their
fault or their folly would be expiated by the blood
of countless thousands of plain and decent American
citizens of the stamp of those, North and
South alike, who in the Civil War laid down all
they had, including life itself, in battling for the
right as it was given to them to see the right.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>But the false prophets of peace have assured
us all along that there is no danger whatever of
war between the United States and any other
country. They tell us further that our armaments
are a menace to other nations; that they
evidence suspicion of other nations, and thereby
place us under suspicion. According to such
philosophy, the college man who becomes an athlete
is a trouble-breeder, for the reason that the
mere possession of muscle makes him a menace
to other men.</p>

<p>Now, if we are in any danger of war, we ought
to do the right thing to secure the safety of our
country, of our homes and our families, and all
things that are dear to us.</p>

<p>If it be true that the possession of armaments
is an inducement for those who have them to use
them, and if it be true that armaments fret the
fighting spirit of other nations as a red rag frets
a bull, and thereby lead to war, then, surely,
we do not need more armaments, but less. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>stead
of arming ourselves any more, we should
disarm until we are defenseless enough to be perfectly
safe. On the other hand, if there be any
likelihood that this country may be invaded by
a foreign foe, we should be prepared to meet the
invaders in the right way, and with the right
spirit.</p>

<p>If it be the proper way to go and meet them as
the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to meet
Alexander, with the keys to our gates, and with
presents and sacrificial offerings, then we should
adopt that way of preparing to pave their path
with flowers and make them drunk on grape-juice
and the milk of human kindness.</p>

<p>Dr. David Starr Jordan believes in disarmament.
He further believes that armor-plate, guns,
battleships, and ammunition should not be made
by private manufacturers, but that, on the contrary,
these things should be made exclusively
by the government, for he is of the opinion that
manufacturers of war materials foment disorder
and promote war in order to bring themselves
more business.</p>

<p>Long association with the manufacturers of
war materials, especially of explosive materials,
has enabled me to know whereof I speak, and I
do know that such a belief is the utterest nonsense.
The manufacturers of war materials with whom I
am acquainted are among the staunchest of peace
men, and they would no more be guilty of promot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ing
war to bring themselves business than a reputable
surgeon would be likely to string a cord
across the street to trip up pedestrians and break
their limbs in order to bring himself business.</p>

<p>In the treatment of human physical ailments,
we should deem it folly to confound remedy with
disease, and to hold the physician responsible for
pestilence. No one would think of looking upon
our science of sanitation and our quarantine system
as breeders and harbingers of pestilence, and
no one would think that our laws against crime
and our system of police protection tend to foster
crime. Yet such is the attitude of many well-intentioned
but overzealous persons with respect
to our naval and military system and armaments.
They consider them breeders and harbingers of
war.</p>

<p>An army and navy are merely a mighty quarantine
system against the pestilence of war. We
must fortify our shores, police our seas with
armor-clads, and be prepared to patrol the skies
with aëroplanes around our entire national horizon
when the need may come.</p>

<p>But it is urged that the people are overburdened
with the cost of maintaining armies and
navies. Assuming that the burden is great, was
it ever less? Was it ever so small as it is now,
compared with the numbers and wealth of the people?
Again, cannot we well afford to bear a considerable
burden of armaments as an insurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
against war, and as a further insurance that if
war comes, it will be far less deadly than it would
be without them?</p>

<p>If Dr. Jordan were better acquainted with the
manufacture of war materials, he would know that
they can be made more cheaply, with equal excellence,
by private concerns, than by the government.
Furthermore, he would know that big
manufacturers of war materials are obliged to
employ a very large force of skilled labor, and
that this labor has to be supplied employment
when there are no government orders for war materials.
For example, the manufacture of armor-plate
by the United States Steel Corporation is
only a small part of that company's business.
The manufacture of guns and armor-plate by the
Bethlehem Steel Company does not keep it constantly
occupied, and it has to furnish other employment
for its men when government orders are
not forthcoming. Consequently, it is obliged to
make things besides armor-plate and guns and
war materials.</p>

<p>The du Pont explosives companies do a far
larger business in high explosives and smokeless
powders for commercial purposes than they do
for government purposes.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the manufacture of war materials
were to be confined entirely to government shops,
then the government would truly have to promote
war to keep its employees busy. At any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the government would have to maintain a large
labor force, making war materials alone, for the
government could not devote itself to the manufacture
of automobiles, chairs, cloth, artificial
leather, dynamite, sporting powder, and the like,
for commercial purposes, as private manufacturers
do.</p>

<p>There is another reason why the private manufacturers
of war materials should be encouraged
by the government, and it is that, in the event of
war, the government would find the large capital
and plants of the wealthy Steel Trust, the Bethlehem
Steel Company, and the du Ponts available
for the purpose of national defense in addition
to the government's own resources. This is very
important.</p>

<p>The battle of Lake Erie was quite as much a
du Pont victory as a Perry victory; for the resources,
energy, and generalship of the du Pont
Powder Company overcame inconceivable difficulties,
carted the powder from Wilmington, Delaware,
all the way overland to Lake Erie, and got
it there on time.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that a person's confidence in
his knowledge of a subject is often directly proportionate
to his ignorance of the subject. It is a
psychological truth that ignorance may be taught,
just like anything else, and a person may become
very erudite in things which are not true, just
as he may in things which are true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Jordan, in recent public utterances, has
said that he would rather the United States should
lose its Pacific possessions than that we should
go to war; and he has remarked that now, while
the world is drunk with war, is a bad time to lay
in more liquor. This is an ingenious metaphor,
and well designed to trip the intelligence of the
unwary. As a matter of fact, when the world is
drunk with war, and rapine, murder, and plunder
are rife, it is exactly the time to lay in more ammunition.</p>

<p>Had Dr. Jordan been in the position of Captain
John Smith in the Virginia colony, when the
Indians were on the war-path, he would have advised
the settlers to disarm and destroy their
stockades and forts. The Indians at that time
went on the war-path and got drunk for war because
they had a grievance.</p>

<p>When the present war is over and international
commerce is re-established, we are destined to
give some other nation a grievance, for the
same reason that we then gave those Indians a
grievance, and that other nation will go on the
war-path, just as those Indians did, and that other
nation when it takes up the torch and the sword
and gets a taste of blood, is going to be as savage
as the men engaged in the present European
conflict.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of true prophets: The one
kind, like Isaiah, who is directly inspired of God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and the other kind, who judges the future by the
lessons of the past. The scientist is a true
prophet; but he is not one of the inspired kind.
The way he does his predicting is the way of the
astronomer, who uses a base line the width of the
earth's orbit in order to triangulate the parallax
of a star. So the scientific prophet triangulates
the parallax of future events from a base line compassing
all human history.</p>

<p>There is no one lesson which history teaches
us more plainly than that the possession of wealth
by a defenseless nation is a standing <i>casus belli</i>
to other nations, and that always there has been
the nation standing ready to attack and plunder
any other nation when there was likely to be
sufficient profit in the enterprise to pay for the
trouble. Never have we seen any treaty stand
for long in the way of such practices between nations.
Treaties have always been mere scraps of
paper, which, like the cobweb, ensnare the weak,
while they let the strong break through.</p>

<p>It is strange that those who recommend that
this country try the experiment of disarmament
to secure peace by setting other nations a great
moral example, should not have read history to see
whether or not the experiment were a new one;
and whether or not, judging by past experiments,
it were likely to prove a success or a failure.
Should these men look back through history, they
would find that ancient Egypt tried the experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>ment,
and went down under the sword and torch
of fierce invaders from over the desert. They
would learn that the Greeks tried the experiment
and found it a failure. They would learn that
India and China have bled through the ages because
of their peaceableness. They would learn
that the fall of Carthage was due not so much
to the superior military power of Rome, or to the
reiterations of Cato that Carthage must be destroyed,
as it was to the peace talk of Hanno,
which withheld the necessary support of Hannibal
in Italy. They would learn that when old Rome
lost her vigor and neglected her defenses, she was
hewn to pieces by fierce barbarians. They would
learn that the fathers of our own country, after
the Revolution, tried the same old experiment,
with the result that the city of Washington was
captured and burned by the British in the war of
1812. They would learn, furthermore, that all
prophets who have said that the nations will war
no more, have been false prophets.</p>

<p>Four years before the Russo-Japanese war, I
wrote an article for a New York magazine, in
which I prophesied that war, and predicted
Japanese victory. I predicted also at the same
time that there would be in the near future a
general European conflict. It has come.</p>

<p>The following quotations from that article may
be of interest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>By far the greatest probability of imminent
war lies in the Far East, between Russia and
Japan. Japan feels the sting of the Russian whip
that made her drop Port Arthur and withdraw
from the continent of Asia, thus relinquishing the
chief advantages gained by her victory over
China. The whole sum paid Japan by China as
a war indemnity has been expended on her
navy and on armaments. In the East, in both
naval and military strength, she is superior to
Russia</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Whether or not we shall soon have war will
depend on whether Japan will quietly wait until
Russia shall have finished the Trans-Siberian
Railway, secured Korea, intrenched and fortified
herself along the Asiatic coast, and built a fleet of
sufficient strength entirely to overawe the little
empire. It is doubtful if Japan will wait for the
time when Russia shall be ready to strangle her.
She may strike and drive Russia from Korea and
secure, as well, a fair share of Chinese territory;
or, what amounts to the same thing, a lease of a
portion of the Celestial Empire. She will thereafter
be better able to protect her interests in
Chinese trade and opportunities. Should she
strike soon, and she and Russia be left to themselves,
Japan ought to win, for she is close at hand
and will be able to bring to bear upon the points
of collision a much greater force than Russia. She</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

<p>At the first annual banquet of the Aëronautical
Society four years ago, I predicted exactly the use
of the aëroplane in war that it has had since that
time. President Taft was one of the speakers,
and his subject was his pet peace and arbitration
treaties. He said that there were not likely to be
the requisite wars for testing out the aëroplane,
as predicted. He said that there was going to be
a shortage of wars.</p>

<p>Since that time, we have had the revolution
in China, the Italian war with Tripoli, the Balkan
wars, a continuous revolutionary performance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Mexico, and finally, we have the present great
European War. Not much of a shortage in wars,
truly!</p>

<p>The following quotation from Dr. David Starr
Jordan's "War and Waste" is an excellent illustration
of the prophetic wisdom that is keeping
the United States of America unprepared against
war:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>What shall we say of the Great War of Europe,
ever threatening, ever impending, and which
never comes? We shall say that it will never
come. Humanly speaking, it is impossible.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Not in the physical sense, of course, for with
weak, reckless, and godless men nothing evil is
impossible. It may be, of course, that some half-crazed
archduke or some harassed minister of
state shall half-knowing give the signal for Europe's
conflagration. In fact, the agreed signal
has been given more than once within the last few
months. The tinder is well dried and laid in such
a way as to make the worst of this catastrophe.
All Europe cherishes is ready for the burning.
Yet Europe recoils and will recoil even in the
dread stress of spoil-division of the Balkan
war....</i></p>

<p>"<i>But accident aside, the Triple Entente lined
up against the Triple Alliance, we shall expect no
war....</i></p>

<p>"<i>The bankers will not find the money for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fight, the industries of Europe will not maintain
it, the statesmen cannot. So whatever the bluster
or apparent provocation, it comes to the same
thing at the end. There will be no general war
until the masters direct the fighters to fight. The
masters have much to gain, but vastly more to
lose, and their signal will not be given.</i>"</p>

<p>Eight years ago, when the great Peace Conference
was held at Carnegie Hall, New York,
to discuss the limitation and abolishment of armaments,
the most notable of the pacifists represented
were invited by the Economic Club of Boston
to attend a banquet in that city for the free
hot-airing of their views.</p>

<p>There was much sophistical palaver about destroying
our old battle-flags and leveling our soldiers'
monuments and all landmarks and reminders
of war. William T. Stead, however, was more
rational, and he was annoyed by the silly impracticable
nonsense of some of the dubs of peace.
Stead's better sense was evidenced by the fact
that the following winter he recommended to the
British Parliament that England build two battleships
to every one built by Germany.</p>

<p>Invited to speak in defense of armaments, I
held that we must arm for peace, and not disarm
for it. I began my remarks by telling them this
story:</p>

<p>In a small paragraph in an obscure place upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the back page of a leading Boston paper, I once
saw the announcement that Herbert Spencer, the
great philosopher, was very ill, and not expected
to live. On the front page of the same paper,
under bold headlines, was a three-column article
on the physical condition of John L. Sullivan.</p>

<p>John L. Sullivan was a fighter, while Herbert
Spencer was only a philosopher; hence the difference
in public interest.</p>

<p>John L. Sullivan, in his time, standing on the
corner, would deplete the hall and break up any
peace meeting in the world, and block the street
with massed humanity for a square, jostling for
a sight of him.</p>

<p>Several years ago, a reverend gentleman by
the name of Charles Edward Jefferson elicited
much applause by his public utterances on the
blessings and advantages of non-resistance and
meekness mild. He made it as clear as the day
dawn of June, to the unreasoning, that it is all
a mistake to build guns, warships, and coast fortifications;
that our war colleges are not institutions
of actual learning at all, but are institutions for
teaching ignorance. He declared that militarism
is squandering the taxpayers' money by the hundreds
of millions, and all because the advocates
of militarism and the friends of militarism are
perverse and wilfully wot not what they do,
though wisdom radiant as the rainbow stares them
in the face; and because our military men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
have been educated at government expense and
who, we have thought, were devoting their lives
to the country's service in studying its needs and
fighting its battles, are desirous merely of promotion
and of widening the sphere of their activities.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Jefferson, these men are not
what we have supposed them&mdash;a bulwark against
trouble, but are trouble-makers, ignorant of the
primary essential of their profession, namely
militant meekness; and instead of being guardians
of peace and an assurance against war, they are
actual war-breeders. He seems to think that there
is a real conspiracy to squander the taxpayers'
money in the interest of a military clique.</p>

<p>A man may be wrong, and yet be honest. Prejudice
is honest. Dr. Jefferson is doubtless honest,
and if it should be that he is right, then his doctrine
is practicable. If he is right, our military
men are wrong. If our army and navy officers,
who have been educated at the public expense and
in the school of experience, do not know and
understand better this country's needs in the respects
and particulars for which they have been
educated than does this good ecclesiastic, then it
is proved that the church is a better military
school than Annapolis or West Point. Theology,
and not military science, should hereafter be
taught in those institutions. The military parade
should be called in from the campus and be
replaced by knee drill in the chapel, and here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>after,
at Annapolis, at West Point, and along the
firing-line, the command should be Shoulder
Psalms, instead of Shoulder Arms.</p>

<p>Let us lay down our arms and spike our guns,
disband the military parade from the campus, as
the sentimentalists desire us to do, and we shall
very soon, with Kubla Khan, hear "ancestral
voices [George Washington's among them]
prophesying war."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>CAN LAW BE SUBSTITUTED FOR WAR?</h3>


<p>I am a peace advocate&mdash;that is to say, I am
one who advocates an active campaign in the
cause of peace, employing the best means and
instruments for the accomplishment of practical
results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a wide difference of opinion exists
in the ranks of those who style themselves
peace advocates as to how the war against war
can best be fought. That difference of opinion is
as to whether we should arm for the fray, or disarm
for it. Shall we go into the fight with sword
and buckler, and with armor on, prepared to return
blow with stronger blow; or shall we go into
the fight with bared breasts, and, when we receive
a blow upon one cheek turn the other cheek also,
and let both our eyes be blackened and our nose
be skinned in order to shame our antagonist, by
giving him an object lesson of the horrors of
war?</p>

<p>Ernst Haeckel has said there is nothing constant
but change. He might have said also that
there is a no more consistent thing in its constancy
than human inconsistency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>That other great philosopher, Herbert Spencer,
declared that, as he grew older, the more and
more he realized the extent to which mankind is
governed by irrationality.</p>

<p>Josh Billings said, "It is not so much the ignorance
of men that makes them ridiculous as what
they know that is not so."</p>

<p>The complex problems of ethics, eugenics,
economics, and human dynamics, which enter into
all questions and problems of peace and war, are
like so many Chinese puzzles to the ordinary
mind.</p>

<p>There are, broadly speaking, two kinds of minds&mdash;the
ratiocinative and the irrational; in other
words, the logical and the illogical. The logical
mind proceeds scientifically from sure premises
to just conclusions, taking no direction and traveling
no faster and no farther in any direction than
warranted and justified by ascertained fact. The
irrational or illogical mind, on the contrary, is
unable to discriminate between belief and knowledge,
between facts and fancies. Consequently,
this type of mind proceeds from guess to conclusion,
with the result that final judgment is
necessarily distorted, warped, and swerved from
truth just in proportion as the basic guess is incorrect
or false.</p>

<p>There is a no more momentous problem before
the world today than that of international jurisprudence,
especially with respect to the mainte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>nance
of peace where practicable, and the control
of wars, when wars are inevitable or necessary;
and there is no subject of such moment more
fruitful of irrationalism.</p>

<p>In the light of practical common-sense, there
is nothing funnier in the writings of Mark Twain
than the inconsistent prating of our peace sophists.
It is as though they let not their right-hand
brain know what their left-hand brain is doing.
They are usually brimmed and primed with sacrificial
sentimentality and over-soul. Their delicatessen
natures shrink from contact with the
stern, man-making realities of life. They are the
disciples of soft stuff. The mush and moonshine
of maudlin sentimentalism are their element.
They possess no powers of discrimination between
the actual and the erroneous. The guise of fact
is no recommendation to them unless it fits into
their scheme. An error is far more welcome if
it comes in a garmenture that conforms with their
ideals. They put their union label on what we receive
by the grace of God, but they fail to recognize
and appreciate that they cannot comprehend
the infinite; that what to them seems disorder
and confusion in the world may be the most perfect
order in the eye of God. They cannot understand
how infinite wisdom, infinite justice, and infinite
mercy should have created a warring world;
consequently, they have set themselves the task
of repairing the faults of creation and of recreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>ing
the world to suit their own ideas as to what
infinite wisdom and mercy ought to be.</p>

<p>When one of these peace sophists gets into a
fight, however, he promptly prays to God to help
him whip the other fellow. The pacific sentimentalist
is usually a most arrant coward. In time
of war, the cowardly sentimental pacifists are
the loudest in appeals to Almighty God to fight on
their side and to lead their army to victory&mdash;that
same army which in time of peace they have done
everything in their power to disarm and disband.</p>

<p>Recently, when speaking at a church, I was
asked the question, "How long is it going to take
to make might right?" I asked my interrogator
this question: "If, at the creation, you had been
consulted and your advice asked as to whether or
not a world should be made in which all life should
feed on other life, and half of the animal creation
should be made prey for the other half; whether
everything should be made tooth and nail, claw
and scale, hunter and hunted, terror and blood,
strife and war; whether or not the cat should
train for the hunt by torturing the little bird&mdash;how
would you have replied to God?" My querist
did not answer me, but went home to think it
over.</p>

<p>I do not purpose to make any apology for Infinite
Wisdom. My pacifist friends are doing that
constantly. It is my humble opinion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Creator did the best He could for us, and that we
ought to be thankful and grateful.</p>

<p>I believe with Pope, that:</p>

<p>
"<i>Spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,<br />
One truth is clear&mdash;whatever is, is right.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>I realize that the most perfect order is confusion
to the mind that is not constituted to comprehend
it.</p>

<p>I know that the macrocosmic mechanism
moves with mathematical exactitude, and that we,
in comparison, are mighty only in our arrogance;
that, in fact, we are but microscopic specks in
the drift of worlds.</p>

<p>Nature seems to care little for individuals, but
very much for races and species; little indeed for
a person, very much for a people.</p>

<p>The terms right and wrong, good and bad, are
entirely relative. Right for an individual may
not be so for a large aggregation of individuals.
The welfare of a nation or a people may not be
the welfare of the world, and God has His eye
on the world.</p>

<p>
<i>The wrong are weak, the right are strong.<br />
This mean the two terms right and wrong;<br />
And truth sought out to any length,<br />
Finds all wrong weakness, all right strength.</i><br />
</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>


<p><span class="smcap">Formative Strife</span></p>

<p>Primeval man found himself thrust into an environment
where all animal life fed on other life,
and half the animal creation was prey for the
other half. He was one of the hunted. Yet, with
less strength but greater cunning, he was destined
to master all. Man's supremacy has been developed
by warfare of wit, craft, and cunning,
versus brute force.</p>

<p>Primitive man found himself "up a tree" in
both the actual and the metaphoric sense. His
teeth and claws were no match for those of the
leopard and the sabre-toothed tiger. He had no
recourse but flight until stern necessity taught
him to wield a club.</p>

<p>Then he climbed down from his abode in trees,
and began the conquest of the earth. The club
made man a traveler. His forays with that
weapon taught him to walk and fight upon his
hind legs, and gave him his erect carriage. But
he had to travel a long and thorny pathway indeed,
armed only with a club, before he invented
the stone hatchet and spear of sharpened flint or
bone. It was a far-flung span across the gulf of
time from the tree-home to the cave in the hill,
his new abiding-place.</p>

<p>The bow and arrow, which enabled him to kill
at long range, were his next weapon, and were the
greatest invention of all time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The protection of the heart with the left arm
and shield, with the right arm free to wield the
sword or hurl the javelin, made man right-handed.</p>

<p>Armed with the bow and arrow, spear and
shield, man was equipped still better for travel;
and ever since travel has been widening out the
sky and broadening man's mental horizon.</p>

<p>The fighting spirit widened the acquaintance
of different peoples, and the terrible menace of
some savage common enemy forced different
tribes to unite and build up nations. Union
against danger is the best instructor of self-government,
and the best guarantee of internal good
behavior.</p>

<p>It is generally recognized that man is a product
of his environment; that he is in body and mind
the sum of his own and ancestral experiences; that
he is omnivorous; that he drinks water and
breathes air; and yet, many persons fail to recognize
the inevitable concomitant conclusion that he
is also of necessity a warring animal, and that the
formative influences of the fierce struggle for existence
have made him what he is. His life is a
series of reactions to environing stimuli; and he
is actuated and shaped by those stimuli, and just
as those stimuli have been necessary to his growth,
so they are still necessary to his continued growth,
and even to his very existence. In other words,
the formative influences that have made and sustained
man are still necessary to his maintenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The character of the strife may be changed, and is
already largely changed, from war to business.
But the intensity of the struggle cannot be alleviated
one whit, because it is impossible, in the
nature of things, to maintain man's strength of
character in any other way. He could live a little
longer without strife than without food or air or
water, but the absence of strife would be as fatal
to him in the end as would be the absence of food,
air, or water.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence has always been a
business proposition with man, and business today
is a struggle for existence as intense and merciless
as the struggle in war.</p>

<p>In olden times, piracy and war for plunder were
the principal business of mankind. Today, business
is a warfare, and though it may be law-abiding,
still the weak go down under it and suffer
and die under it as surely as they did in old-time
wars. The relation of strength to weakness
remains unchanged, and the reward for strength
and the penalty for weakness are as great as they
ever were.</p>

<p>There now exists, as always, the same intensity
of incentive of all classes to strive for something
more and something better than they have.
Though the condition of all classes has improved,
the struggle of individual with individual is as
great, the strife of class with class is as intense
as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The ownership of one's earnings, with freedom
to apply and enjoy them, was the greatest prize
ever offered to stimulate the working genius of
this world, and the results during the past hundred
and fifty years have been phenomenal.</p>

<p>The world has progressed more within that
time in those things which tend to complete living
than it had previously progressed in all the
ages that had dragged their slow length along
since the world thawed out of the ancient ice.</p>

<p>But human agencies, like all agencies in nature,
are essentially rhythmical. In order to accumulate
the necessary energy and enthusiasm to go
far enough in the right direction, we inevitably
go too far, and, when the pendulum returns, it
swings to the other extreme.</p>

<p>It is important to realize the great truth that
freedom ends when it aims beyond the spirit
which strives for the greatest good to the greatest
number.</p>

<p>According to Herbert Spencer, the criminal
classes are composed of those who have been
pushed out of the race in the struggle for existence
under modern conditions. They were normal
components of society in the past, when all men
were soldiers and all soldiers were bandits, and
the principal business of mankind was piracy and
war for plunder.</p>

<p>There being no longer the ever-present opportunity
to join in an inter-tribal or an international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
war for robbery, the soldier-bandit now makes
war upon society.</p>

<p>All of the Huns and Vandals in our midst are
today armed with the short-sword of the ballot.
How important it is then that they should be
taught to know and to understand that in the
use of this weapon their work should be formative
and not deformative; that it should be constructive
and not destructive!</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Substitution of Law for War</span></p>

<p>The poet's words, "The parliament of man, the
federation of the world," have become a very
familiar quotation in recent years. Anciently all
wisdom was taught in poesy, and we have never
yet quite freed ourselves from the age-long habitude
of receiving as unimpeachable wisdom whatever
may be said in verse.</p>

<p>To the common mind, a statement in didactic
verse has the proselyting power of Holy Writ.
Now, this line of Tennyson, "The parliament of
man, the federation of the world," points us
toward a Utopia, without hope of actual attainment.</p>

<p>There is at the present time a growing good
intention to put an end to wars by international
conciliation and arbitration; in short, to substitute
law for war. We must, however, keep
strongly in mind the interdependence of law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
force, and the consequent interdependence of international
law and armaments. Conciliation must
not be confounded with arbitration, and persuasion
must not be confounded with law.</p>

<p>Law has been aptly designated "codified custom."
Actually, law is an attempt to construct
experience into prophecy. We are able to judge
of the sufficiency of new laws only by the sufficiency
of laws in past practice.</p>

<p>The error is very common, to confound as having
the same meaning terms of quite opposite
meanings&mdash;for example, it is a very common error
to confound society with government, and
civilization with enlightenment. Society is an
order of things by virtue of which we are able
to co-operate with one another and to enjoy mutuality
of possessions which gives them their only
value; while government is an order of things for
the purpose of protecting society.</p>

<p>The world has arrived at great enlightenment,
and has attained some degree of civilization.
Self-interest is becoming more and more altruistic,
and altruism is becoming more and more profitable.
We are not so barbarous as we used to be,
but we still slaughter one another to adjust international
differences. This cannot be esteemed
civil procedure. Enlightenment may be very uncivil,
and civility may not be enlightenment.</p>

<p>The great problem yet remains of uniting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
practical laws the nations of the earth into a
family of nations.</p>

<p>This is not a work for dreamers or sentimentalists;
but is purely a business proposition, which
can be effected only to the extent that the best interests
of all the contracting parties are thereby
secured.</p>

<p>When will arbitration be able to realize the
Utopian dreams of the pacifists? General Homer
Lea answers the question once for all in the following
expressive terms:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Only when arbitration is able to unravel the
tangled skein of crime and hypocrisy among individuals
can it be extended to communities and
nations. Thence will International Arbitration
come of its own accord as the natural outgrowth
of national evolution through the individual. As
nations are only man in the aggregate, they are
the aggregate of his crimes and deception and
depravity, and so long as these constitute the
basis of individual impulse, so long will they control
the acts of nations.</i></p>

<p>"<i>When, therefore, the merchant arbitrates with
the customer he is about to cheat; when trusts
arbitrate with the people they are about to fleece;
when the bulls and bears arbitrate with the lambs
they are about to shear; when the thief arbitrates
with the man he is about to rob, or the murderer
with his victim, and so on throughout the category<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of crime, then will communities be able to dispense
with laws, and international thievery and
deception, shearing and murder, resort to arbitration.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The men who control our city and state politics
and make and enforce our city and state laws all
over the country are not always honest, but, on
the contrary, they are often notoriously corrupt,
notwithstanding the fact that they have much
stronger incentives to be honest here than they
would have in dealing with foreign nations and
strange peoples. What, therefore, are we to expect
of their integrity and their honesty in the
settlement of international disputes and in the
enactment and execution of international laws?</p>

<p>What an enormous field for graft it will be
when some weaker nation tries to get its rights at
the coming international tribunal!</p>

<p>Our laws are now notoriously inadequate with
respect to theft, burglary, highway robbery, and
municipal-government graft. The amount of
money loss to the people of this country through
the failure of our laws to suppress these iniquities
is enough to support a standing army of half a
million men, build four battleships a year, and
place us on such a defensive footing as absolutely
to preclude all danger of war with any foreign
power.</p>

<p>Has human nature improved so much lately that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
special privilege will no longer result from special
power? Has the human race progressed so much
lately that privilege and oppression will not follow
power; wealth and luxury follow privilege;
and degeneracy and disorganization follow wealth
and luxury?</p>

<p>The race has certainly not so altered that men
do not grow old and die; and nations, like men,
have their youth, their middle age, their decrepitude
and death.</p>

<p>Periodically, some religio-pathological sect will
announce the conclusion of an understanding with
the Great Reaper, whereby, through certain incantations
or breathing exercises, death may be
indefinitely postponed; but they, like other mortals,
keep on dying.</p>

<p>Those good men who are the leaders in the
present peace movement must realize the fact
that the carrying out of their project will devolve,
not upon them&mdash;not upon the philanthropist,
the sentimentalist, and the humanitarian&mdash;but
upon the politician.</p>

<p>The actual procedure of the Hague congresses
enables us to forecast exactly this result. The
judicial bench of that court was a bargain-counter,
over which political advantage was bartered for
political advantage. It was no real love of peace
that dominated those tribunals: only the powerful
nations spoke or were heard. No protection was
suggested for the weaker nations, who, presum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>ably,
would be most benefited by international
arbitration. They were quite out of the running.</p>

<p>International arbitration will ultimately become
a political machine. Nothing can prevent it, and
there is no reason to believe that those politicians
who will have control of the international arbitration
machine will be any more honest than
other machine politicians.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">All Law Must Be Backed by Force</span></p>

<p>It is a popular belief that when the paradoxical
conciliatory legal persuasion in the form of arbitration
goes into effect, we shall no longer require
any armaments, but may forge our swords
into plow-shares and spears into pruning-hooks,
disband our armies, and return the soldiers to
the shops and farms.</p>

<p>We are prone to forget that law is as much a
representative of the requisite power behind it for
its enforcement as a paper dollar is a representative
of the requisite gold available for its redemption.
A well-known orator came very near becoming
President through a popular misconception as
to the interdependence of gold and paper money,
and he failed to get the Presidency because of a
public awakening to the error.</p>

<p>We are prone to forget, furthermore, that it is
the respect for power behind law that makes possible
its enforcement. Any law to adjust interna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>tional
differences by arbitration will simply be an
embodiment of the collective wisdom of allied
Powers in the exercise of force, and a force that
is representative of their banded armies and
navies.</p>

<p>International law is static military force. War
is the dynamic form of the same force. I believe
in international arbitration for all it is worth. It
is a good thing to push along. It will unquestionably
lessen the frequency of wars, but many wars
are sure to come in spite of it, and because of it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Non-Justiciable Differences</span></p>

<p>There are ills of national bodies politic that can
be cured only by the sword. Insurmountable differences
between various nations and races of
men are always sure to arise, as impossible to
arbitrate as the differences between the herbivora
and the carnivora.</p>

<p>The existence of the carnivora depends upon the
sacrifice of the herbivora. Their interests are,
from their very nature, antagonistic, and their
differences are, by consequence, insurmountable,
and not justiciable. The harmony of nature depends
upon inharmony between the meat-eaters
and the vegetable-eaters, and the harmony of
modern progress has likewise depended in large
measure upon formative inharmony between
peoples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Such radical differences and such concomitant
radical diversity of interests exist among the various
races of men that the task of harmonizing
their interests, aims, and activities will be about
as great as would be that of bleaching their skins
to a uniform color.</p>

<p>It is a practical impossibility to enact international
laws that will make the welfare of each
nation the concern of all, with no subordination
of any one to the welfare of another. Will arbitration
be able to place all peoples upon a plane of
equality? Will it be able to secure to all, even
the meanest, equal rights to enjoyment of property,
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?</p>

<p>Will arbitration be able to make the Anglo-Saxon,
the Teuton, the African, and the Oriental
meet one another on common ground, and share
and share alike, live and let live, when their interests
come into collision?</p>

<p>If arbitration cannot do this&mdash;if arbitration
does not do this&mdash;if it does not treat all with strict
impartiality, then those who are ill-treated are
going to rebel, and wars will still come.</p>

<p>Between nations no sentimental consideration
exists or is possible, sufficiently effectual to exert
more than the merest microscopic influence as a
deterrent of war. Self-interest always has been,
and always will be, the deciding factor in the
settlement of international disputes. War un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>cloaks
international hypocrisy, and the people are
seen in their true character.</p>

<p>The attitude of the warlike and powerful nations
in the past toward the weaker nations has
been very similar to that of the carnivora toward
the herbivora.</p>

<p>International arbitration may somewhat lessen
the burden of armaments, but the time will be long
before it can lift the burden. The orators who
plead at the International Tribunal will speak in
the voice of the deep-throated guns behind them;
their persuasion will be that of cold steel, and
neither brotherly love nor international sympathy
will be their guide, but self-interest, and no demands
will be relinquished except from policy in
their observance of such rights of others as are
warded by the frowning ramparts of opposing
force.</p>

<p>Unless all the nations of the world join in the
pact, then arbitration will simply be an alliance
for the benefit of the allies themselves as against
all others. There will be nothing new in such an
arrangement. The Six Nations of New York did
the same thing; they formed a federation and settled
their differences by arbitration, and it was
a good thing for the Six Nations; but it was not
a good thing for the neighboring Indian tribes.</p>

<p>We Americans expect to get all we want any
way, either with or without arbitration. If we
expected that the Chinese would be forced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
us, or our rights and privileges curtailed in the
Orient, we should not think of joining in an arbitration
pact for a minute.</p>

<p>There will always be the warfare of commerce
for the markets of the world, and it will be tempered
with avarice, not mercy; and commercial
warfare will become more and more severe as the
nations grow, and as competition, with want and
hunger behind it, gets keen as the sword-edge
with the crowding of people into the narrow world.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Unchanging Human Nature</span></p>

<p>Human nature is the same today as it was in
the ante-rebellion days of human slavery. It is
the same as it was when Napoleon, with the will-o'-the-wisp
of personal and national glory held
before the eyes of emotional and impressionable
Frenchmen, led them to wreck for him the monarchies
of Europe. Human nature is the same today
as it was in Cæsar's time, when he massacred
two hundred and fifty thousand Germans&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;in a day, in cold blood,
while negotiations for peace were pending, and entered
in his diary the simple statement, "Cæsar's
legions killed them all." Human nature is the
same today as it was in the cruel old times, when
war was the chief business of mankind, and populations
sold as slaves were among the most profitable
plunder. Yes, human nature is the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as it has always been. Education and Christian
teaching have made pity and sympathy more familiar
to the human heart, but avarice and the old
fighting spirit are kept in leash only by the dominance
of necessity and circumstances, which the
institutions of civilization impose upon the individual.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from "Origins and
Destiny of Imperial Britain," by the late Professor
J. A. Cramb:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>War may change its shape, the struggle here
intensifying it, there abating it; it may be uplifted
by ever loftier purposes and nobler causes.
But cease? How shall it cease?</i></p>

<p>"<i>Indeed, in the light of history, universal peace
appears less as a dream than as a nightmare,
which shall be realized only when the ice has crept
to the heart of the sun, and the stars, left black
and trackless, start from their orbits.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Max Müller has told us that the roots of some
of our words are older than the Egyptian Pyramids.
Far older still are the essential traits of
human nature. The human nature of today will
be the human nature of tomorrow, and the human
nature of tomorrow will be in all essential respects
the same as it was in ancient Rome, Persia, and
Egypt, and even in the palmy days of sea-sunk
Atlantis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The best of us are at heart barbarians under
a thin veneer of civilization, and it is as natural
for us to revert to barbarous war as for the hog
to return to his wallow.</p>

<p>If we were able to apply to the upbuilding of
our Army and Navy the money that goes to political
graft throughout the country, and the money
that has been squandered, and is still being squandered
through our notorious vote-purchasing pensions,
we could place ourselves upon a war footing
that would be an absolute guarantee of permanent
peace. It is not, therefore, very encouraging, to
enlarge this failing system of laws, in order to
save an annual expenditure certainly less than
what the defects of our laws now cost the country.</p>

<p>Even though international wars may be prevented
by a court of arbitration, can rebellion and
civil war be prevented, and ought they always to
be prevented?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Justifiable Wars</span></p>

<p>When the unjust laws of an iniquitous government
make existence intolerable for the great mass
of the people of a country or of a colonial possession;
"when in the course of human events, it
becomes necessary" for a people to throw off the
yoke of oppression, as we did in our War of the
Revolution, or as the French people did in the
French Revolution, or as the great Chinese peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ple
have lately done by their rebellion against the
domination of an intolerable savage Manchu monarchy,
then war is the only remedy, and freedom
can then plead only with the sword.</p>

<p>I quote the following from Theodore Roosevelt's
"America and the World War":</p>

<p>"<i>In 1864 there were in the North some hundreds
of thousands of men who praised peace as
the supreme end, as a good more important than
all other goods, and who denounced war as the
worst of all evils. These men one and all assailed
and denounced Abraham Lincoln, and all
voted against him for President. Moreover, at
that time there were many individuals in England
and France who said it was the duty of those two
nations to mediate between the North and the
South, so as to stop the terrible loss of life and
destruction of property which attended our Civil
War; and they asserted that any Americans who
in such event refused to accept their mediation
and to stop the war would thereby show themselves
the enemies of peace. Nevertheless, Abraham
Lincoln and the men back of him by their
attitude prevented all such effort at mediation,
declaring that they would regard it as an unfriendly
act to the United States. Looking back
from a distance of fifty years, we can now see
clearly that Abraham Lincoln and his supporters
were right. Such mediation would have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hostile act, not only to the United States but to
humanity. The men who clamored for unrighteous
peace fifty years ago this fall were the
aenemies of mankind.</i>"</p>

<p>Those who are oppressed by the superincumbent
weight of society, and labor for mere existence,
with no hope of freedom from poverty, are
slaves as much as were those made bondsmen in
old-time wars. It matters little whether the wolf
at the door be a creature of sociological conditions,
or a creature of war. The evil is no less
real.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, in his admirable poem on
France and the French Revolution, said about the
most expressive, the most potential, and altogether
the best thing that has ever been said illustrative
of the uncontrollable massiveness of the
popular will, which, under the stimulus of patriotism
or the smart or burden of accumulated
wrongs, can stampede a nation into war:</p>

<p>
"<i>As, flake by flake, the beetling avalanches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Build up their imminent crags of noiseless snow,</span><br />
Till some chance thrill the loosened ruin launches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the blind havoc leaps unwarned below,</span><br />
So grew and gathered through the silent years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The madness of a People, wrong by wrong.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
There seemed no strength in the dumb toiler's tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No strength in suffering;&mdash;but the Past was strong:</span><br />
The brute despair of trampled centuries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leapt up with one hoarse yell and snapt its bands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Groped for its rights with horny, callous hands,</span><br />
And stared around for God with bloodshot eyes.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>The justification of war depends entirely upon
the conditions which produce it. In short, war is
justifiable only when it is a remedy for evils
greater than the evils of the war. War is sometimes
a very bitter remedy; nevertheless, there
are diseases much worse than the remedy. The
horrors of the French Revolution, bad as they
were, remedied a condition still more horrible, for
the condition of the French common people,
"bowed by the weight of centuries," had become
so abject that life was intolerable; no change
could be for the worse. Under such circumstances
there is no fear of death; the fear of death is only
fear of the loss of life through love of life. When
existence is intolerable, and there is no hope in
the heart for better things, life, having no value,
is not much loved, and death has no terrors.</p>

<p>In spite of all the bloodshed of the reign of
terror, in spite of all who fell under the leadership
of Napoleon, the French people were benefited
by the Revolution a thousand-fold more than
they were injured by it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>If arbitration could prevent such wars, which
are man's God-given privilege that a people may
secure its inalienable rights, then arbitration, in
that respect, would be an iniquitous thing.</p>

<p>War, at best, is a horrible business. It is a
reversion to the brute force of primitive savagery,
and is never justifiable except in the extremity
of last resort. But we must appreciate and acknowledge
the fact that the horrors of war, the
sacrifice of treasure, the sacrifice of life, are no
arguments whatever against war when inalienable
human rights are at stake that must be fought
for, and that are worth the sacrifice.</p>

<p>There are at times objects and obligations which
are worth the sacrifice. To prevent war in such
cases would be a disgrace and a crime.</p>

<p>As Admiral Mahan says, "Even the material
evils of war are less than the moral evil of compliance
with wrong."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Christianity and War</span></p>

<p>In 1901, the editor of <i>The Christian Herald</i>
requested me to write an article in answer to the
following question: "Is it consistent for a loyal
Christian, who believes that war is contrary to
the teachings of the Prince of Peace, to engage in
the manufacture of material designed exclusively
for the purpose of war?"</p>

<p>In my reply, I pointed out that the great ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>jority
of Christians throughout the world, while
they hate war, are often called upon themselves
to become warriors and to fight for their doctrine
of peace. The Rev. T. De Witt Talmage was
chosen to reply to my article, which he did by
agreeing with all I had said.</p>

<p>According to the annals of history, wars have
almost invariably been caused by one party attempting
to rob another party, or one people another
people. On such occasions, it is self-evident
that the blame for the wars rested with the robbers.
Those who fought in defense of their lives
and property, although actual participants in
warfare, were guiltless.</p>

<p>Of course, the attempt to rob and plunder has
sometimes been mutual, and both participants
have been aggressors, as were Napoleon and
Alexander in the Russian war. In the great majority
of cases, however, one side has been on the
aggressive, and the other on the defensive.</p>

<p>When an officer of the law catches an evil-doer
in the act, and is attacked by him, if, in making
an arrest, the officer is compelled to draw his own
revolver and shoot the malefactor, he does a justifiable
act. We have here war in miniature, and
it may be taken as a type of all wars. While we
are free to grant that wars are wrong, yet the
wrong rests entirely with the offenders, instead
of with the defenders, of human right.</p>

<p>Housebreaking is wrong, yet the brave knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
who, in mediæval times, breached a castle wall to
free some prisoner unjustly held, did a wholly
commendable act. Similarly, one nation which
raises an army to free from bondage slaves held
by another nation, does an equally commendable
act, and the blame for the war rests with those
who hold the slaves.</p>

<p>War is an ugly and an awful thing, while some
peace theories are very beautiful, and they are
quite safe in times of peace; but when, in the past,
slaves had to be freed, then the true Christians
took down their old swords and shouldered their
old guns, and went to the front. If we read the
inscriptions on the monuments erected to the
memory of those who died in our great Civil War,
we find it was an army of Christians who fell.</p>

<p>War is often a necessity. It cannot always be
avoided, and, when it comes, we want the best
tools we can get with which to fight. It is criminal
negligence for a nation not to be prepared against
war. It is criminal negligence for a great nation
not to be abreast of the times in arms and equipment.</p>

<p>Often at the bayonet's point, trade and civilization
and even Christianity, have been forced upon
the savage, and upon exclusive and unwarlike
peoples, and now Christianity, civilization, and
militarism, sisters of strange relation, hand in
hand, embrace the world.</p>

<p>In "Sartor Resartus" Carlyle says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>The first ground handful of nitre, sulphur,
and charcoal drove Monk Schwartz's pestle
through the ceiling. What will the last do?</i>"</p>

<p>His own answer is that it will</p>

<p>"... <i>achieve the final undisputed prostration
of force under thought, of animal courage under
spiritual</i>."</p>

<p>Again Carlyle says, in the same work:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Such I hold to be the genuine use of gunpowder:
that it makes all men alike tall. Nay, if
thou be cooler, cleverer than I, if thou have more
mind, though all but no body whatever, then canst
thou kill me first, and art the taller. Hereby, at
last is the Goliath powerless and the David resistless;
savage animalism is nothing, inventive
spiritualism is all</i>."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>What does the Bible say about Christ's mission
of peace?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men" (Luke II: 13, 14).</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

<p>"<i>And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of
the Highest ... to guide our feet into the way
of peace" (Luke I: 76, 79).</i></p>

<p>"<i>And his name shall be called ... The Prince
of Peace" (Is. IX: 6).</i></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>I hold that there is nothing whatever in the foregoing
quotations inconsistent with warring for the
right. From the nature of things, war is often
the price of peace, and justice can only be enforced
by the sword. In the great American Rebellion
it was the voice of guns alone that could
command the emancipation of the slaves.</p>

<p>An apostle of the Prince of Peace may often
best serve his Master by becoming a good soldier.
The Christian armies that turned back and drove
out of Europe the invading Moors rendered their
Master better service than had they, in order to
escape war, fled before the advancing hosts of
Islam.</p>

<p>Should China and India become really aroused
and advance during the next twenty-five years as
rapidly as has Japan during a like period in the
past, and should the great "Yellow Peril" rise
in its might, and threaten the Christian World, is
there a single soldier of the Cross now enlisted in
the cause of Peace who would not then buckle on
his cartridge-belt, shoulder his gun, and go and
fight in the defense of his religion and his home?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>I must confess my belief that, if invasion were
threatened on the Atlantic Coast, some of the
pacifists I have met would not buckle on the cartridge-belt,
but would, on the contrary, gird up
their loins, take the advice of Horace Greeley, and
go West.</p>

<p>Let us again quote from the Scriptures:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>The Lord is a man of war" (Ex. XV: 3).</i></p>

<p>"<i>The Lord of Hosts is his name" (Is. LI: 15).</i></p>

<p>"<i>Blessed be the Lord my strength, which
teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight"
(Ps. CXLIV: 1).</i></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>It is evident that the modern Christian misunderstands
Christ's true mission, for he said:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Think not that I am come to send peace on
earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"
(Matt. X: 34).</i></p>

<p>"<i>I am come to send fire on the earth" (Luke
XII: 49).</i></p>

<p>"<i>And he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment
and buy one ... for the things concerning
me have an end" (Luke XXII: 36, 37).</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>St. Paul said:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister
of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil" (Rom. XIII: 4).</i></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Dr. Lyman Abbott, who is one of the best of
America's big men, and one of the biggest of
America's best men, has the following to say
about war:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>I am not, therefore, one of those who think
that war is always wrong. I cannot think that
Jesus Christ Himself inculcated the doctrine that
force never could be used&mdash;He who, when He saw
the traders in the Temple, did not wait to argue
with them nor to appeal to their conscience, for
He knew that they had neither reason nor conscience,
but drove them out with a whip of small
cords, driving the cattle before Him and overturning
the tables of the money-changers and letting
the money roll upon the floor. I am not
afraid to follow Him with whatsoever force it may
be necessary for righteousness to put on, when
unrighteousness has armed herself to commit
wrong. I cannot think all war is wrong. If I did,
I should not want to look upon a Bunker Hill
Monument, for it would be a monument to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
shame; I should want never to speak the name of
Gettysburg, for my lips would blister and my
cheeks would blush; I should want to bury in the
grave of oblivion the names of Washington and
Grant.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>There can be but one interpretation of Christian
duty and but one interpretation of true peace.
Without justice, the mere absence of war does not
constitute peace to the Christian. Neither to the
Christian is warfare waged in the interest of
justice incompatible with the peace principles
which underlie his religious faith. Therefore, the
true interpretation of peace is absence of war,
where justice reigns, and the true Christian mission
is to see that justice be done, for without
it there can be no righteous peace. Such peace as
can reign with injustice becomes the abettor of
injustice.</p>

<p>While I believe in international conciliation and
arbitration, peace and good will, I do not believe
in unlimited arbitration. I do not believe that
arbitration can ever be a universal panacea with
which all evils can be cured without resort to
firearms. There are times when throats have to
be cut, and when God is on the side of the executioner.</p>

<p>When a nation persists perennially in war, it
can only be brought to peace by some other nation
which will meet it on the battlefield. Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
established the dictum that they who take the
sword shall perish by the sword. War begets
war. The sword brings the sword. As Napoleon
said about sparing murderers and abolishing capital
punishment, "<i>Que messieurs les assassins commencent</i>."</p>

<p>We want to put a stop to wars to save life. I
wonder why it is that we are not equally anxious
to prevent loss of life from other causes besides
war. Why are we not equally interested in preventing
the tremendous loss of life from easily
preventable railroad disasters? An international
movement for safety equipment and sanitation,
with an enlistment of effort and money equal to
that being devoted to this great peace movement
would save many more lives every year than the
annual loss in the Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>Dr. Strong, President of the American Institute
of Social Service, stated at a dinner several years
ago, that the number of persons killed and
wounded every year in the United States alone by
railroad accidents, steamship accidents, workshop
accidents, accidents in the streets, and other accidents&mdash;all
very largely due to preventable causes&mdash;amounts
to more than 500,000. In the Japanese-Russian
war a total of 333,786 men were killed
and wounded on both sides, not counting the losses
in naval battles. During the same period in the
United States alone the great army of American
laborers engaged in manufacturing and building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
operations suffered a loss of 425,000 killed and
injured; 92,000 more were therefore killed and
injured in our industries in one year than during
that entire war.</p>

<p>I wonder why it is that we are not as enthusiastic
in this social-service work as we are in
attacking the problem of war. Is it that there is
more glory and more that appeals to the martial
imagination in attacking war and warriors than
there is in the prosaic, tame, and glamourless
enterprise of simply saving human life in peaceful
pursuits for the mere sake of saving it? Is it
the old war spirit in the breasts of the peace men
that moves them? Are they fighters, too? In attacking
war, do they feel that they are somehow
identified with the pomp and circumstance of
glorious war?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>OUR INCONSISTENT MONROE DOCTRINE</h3>

<blockquote><p>"If you want war, nourish a doctrine. Doctrines are the most
frightful tyrants to which men ever are subject, because doctrines
get inside of a man's own reason and betray him against himself."</p>

<p>
<i>William Graham Sumner</i>, "<i>War and Other Essays</i>."<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>A doctrine is a creed, usually mandatory,
framed by one person or set of persons,
for the belief or conduct of another person
or set of persons. A doctrine is not necessarily
based upon principles of right, equity, justice, or
even expediency.</p>

<p>Doctrines are directions written on the guide-boards
of fanaticism. An exact truth is never
proclaimed as a doctrine: there is no doctrine of
mathematics.</p>

<p>The Monroe Doctrine, which pledged the
United States to defend American republican institutions,
north and south, against monarchical
encroachments from the Old World, with the
dependable support of England, was proclaimed
in 1823, mainly in response to a Continental doctrine
called the Holy Alliance, formed in 1815
by and between Austria, Russia, Prussia, and
France. The Holy Alliance was in effect a sys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>tem
of mutual political monarchical insurance,
under which the forces of the allied Powers could
be used to subdue revolution against the institution
of kingship.</p>

<p>The French Revolution, followed by the democratic
empire of Napoleon, had severely shaken
the old intolerant and intolerable order of things.
The Holy Alliance was an expedient of the old
order to insure itself against democratic institutions.</p>

<p>A revolution in Spain in 1820 was promptly
suppressed by the Holy Alliance, and the Spanish
people, who had raised their heads and begun to
look around for freedom, were again bowed under
the yoke of the detested Bourbons. The Holy Alliance
was surely a most unholy alliance.</p>

<p>Russia, by a ukase in 1821, claimed the right to
keep the vessels of all other Powers out of the
North Pacific Ocean. That was a Russian "Monroe
Doctrine" which helped to make Monroe a
doctrinaire.</p>

<p>In 1823 Spain lost, through revolutions, all of
her American possessions except Cuba and Porto
Rico, and Portugal had lost Brazil. France had
lost the island of Haiti.</p>

<p>The United States naturally sympathized with
the newly-formed states built on the ruins of the
Spanish and Portuguese empires. They had
mostly adopted republican institutions, becoming
sisters of the great northern republic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>James Monroe was not the father of the child
named for him, for the actual formulator of the
Monroe Doctrine was John Quincy Adams, at that
time Secretary of State, who got the cue from
George Canning.</p>

<p>England wanted unrestricted trade with the
Spanish-American countries; she had no need of
additional territory on the American continent,
but she saw danger in its acquisition by other nations.
George Canning tried four times in 1823
to get the United States to join England in her
declaration of the open-door policy. Monroe favored
the proposal, but finally Adams convinced
the President that it would be better to avoid any
entangling arrangement with England, and to
stand alone.</p>

<p>On the second of December, 1823, in his annual
message to Congress, President Monroe made the
following declaration on behalf of the United
States:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>The American continents, by the free and independent
condition which they have assumed and
maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as
subjects for future colonization by European
powers.... We should consider any attempt
on their part to extend their system to any portion
of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace
and safety. With the existing colonies or dependencies
of any European power we have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
interfered and shall not interfere. But with the
governments who have declared their independence
and maintained it, and whose independence
we have, on great consideration and on just principles,
acknowledged, we could not view any interposition
for the purpose of oppressing them or
controlling, in any other manner, their destiny,
by any European power, in any other light than
as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition
toward the United States.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Such was the birth of the famous Monroe Doctrine.
Its recognition by England made it effective.
The Monroe Doctrine has nothing whatever
to do with international law. It is simply an
expression of British national policy for the
United States.</p>

<p>Our diplomacy, being a branch of our politics,
is often inconsistent with our national policy.
American justification for the doctrine appears
to have been mainly dependent upon the fact that
we had no intentions of encroaching upon the
spheres of influence of any of the nations of the
Old World, but that we intended to safeguard
what we conceived to be our legitimate sphere of
influence.</p>

<p>The American Republic was very young when
the Monroe Doctrine was proclaimed&mdash;a doctrine
which, as one writer has said, is "the most mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>nificent
bluff in all history, and so far the most
successful."</p>

<p>During the American Civil War, France, with
the connivance of England, conceived the plan of
establishing in Mexico the empire of Maximilian.
We were too busy at the time, settling some little
differences of opinion within our family of
states, to exact recognition of our protest. After
the memorable exchange of compliments and
courtesies between Grant and Lee at Appomattox,
however, Uncle Sam indicated to Napoleon the
Little that the Imperialists must be kicked out.
Lacking the support of France, they were kicked
out by the Mexicans.</p>

<p>While through the Monroe Doctrine the United
States served notice on the nations of the Old
World to keep hands off the American continent,
the doctrine at the same time constituted an implied
promise on our part to keep hands off any
territory beyond the confines of America. So
long as the policies of Great Britain did not run
counter to our Monroe Doctrine, it was destined
to be quite effective in preventing land-grabbing
on the American continent by other European
Powers. But the Monroe Doctrine possesses an
innate dog-in-the-manger aspect, certain some day
to bring trouble, for the great nations of the world
have far outgrown the expectations of our forefathers;
their commerce has become an inseparable
part of the commerce of South American
countries, and their interests in like measure
have become identified with the interests of those
countries. Just to the extent that their welfare
and the welfare of the South American republics
become mutual are they likely to be brought into
collision with the Monroe Doctrine, and, when the
collision comes, it means war, unless the United
States abandons that doctrine.</p>

<span class="caption">The Vast Territory That Our Inflated Monroe Doctrine Obligates Us to Defend</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>Our self-assumed protectorate over the South
American republics is not welcomed by those
countries. They resent our arrogance. We have
never cultivated trade with them, nor joined them
in the development of their industries, and have
never financed their enterprises. Even when an
American citizen has paid a visit to a South American
country, he has first found it necessary to go
to England and take ship from there.</p>

<p>The European countries, on the other hand,
have promoted business relations with the South
American republics, have supplied them with
working capital and cultivated their friendship,
confidence, and respect, while we have done nothing
of the sort.</p>

<p>The citizens of the United States whom the
South Americans have seen in their dominions
have usually been adventurous, irresponsible fortune-hunters.
Their trouble-breeding propensities
have not tended to foster amicable feeling
between the great Republic of the North and her
Southern sisters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>So long as the Monroe Doctrine did not circumscribe
the ambitions of the United States the
institution possessed some semblance of vitality;
but, when the explosion came that blew up the
<i>Maine</i>, it also exploded the Monroe Doctrine, for
immediately the United States, abandoning its
time-honored policy of keeping within American
confines, and out of entangling alliances and complications
with other nations, reached out a grasping
hand and seized upon the Far Pacific possessions
of Spain, right at the door of China and
within the legitimate sphere of influence of Japan.
Yet, curiously enough, we still adhere to the old
proclamation, America for the Americans, oblivious
of the equal right of China and Japan to
proclaim, Asia for the Asiatics.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I spoke at a luncheon of
the Twentieth Century Club in Boston. I was
seated beside a noted Japanese diplomat. He
said, "Mr. Maxim, you have a Monroe Doctrine&mdash;America
for the Americans; we also have a
similar doctrine&mdash;Asia for the Asiatics; but we
are not ready to enforce ours yet, and you are not
ready, and are not likely to be ready, to enforce
yours. A little later, we shall inquire by what
logic you can proclaim America for the Americans,
and disclaim our right equally to proclaim
Asia for the Asiatics."</p>

<p>The Japanese are a far-seeing and a patient
people. They know how to wait, but they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
also when to strike, and how to strike with the
force of a Jovian thunderbolt. They are no
longer merely a cute little picture-book people.
They have risen with stupendous strides into a
very eminent position as a World-Power, a Power
to be reckoned with. They are different from us,
but we have no right to consider them our inferiors.
They may very possibly prove to be our
superiors. A government of the people and for
the people is a failure if the government does not
take measures for the adequate defense of the
people. Self-preservation is the first law of nature.
Consequently, it is a law which must be observed
as the chief element of greatness.</p>

<p>I quote the following from "The Valor of Ignorance,"
by General Homer Lea:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>How unreasonable is it to expect that the
combined nations of Europe, with all their military
strength, shall remain restricted to one-twelfth
of this world's land, burrowed into and
hewn over for the last thousand years, while this
Republic, without armies, shall maintain dominion
over one-half the unexploited lands of the world!
Or that Japan, possessed of two-thirds the population
of this nation and a military organization
fifty-fold greater, shall continue to exist on her
rocky isles that are, inclusive of Korea, but one-two-hundred-and-fiftieth
of the earth's lands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
while an undefended one-half lies under the guns
of her battleships!</i></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"<i>The Monroe Doctrine is Promethean in conception,
but not so in execution. It was proclaimed
in order to avoid wars; now it invites
them....</i></p>

<p>"<i>The Monroe Doctrine, if not supported by
naval and military power sufficient to enforce its
observance by all nations, singly and in coalition,
becomes a factor more provocative of war than
any other national policy ever attempted in modern
or ancient times.... Societies, religions,
unions, business men, and politicians on the one
hand, spare no effort to debase every militant
instinct and military efficiency or preparation
necessary for its enforcement, while, on the other,
they demand that the Chief Executive shall assert
to the entire world this Republic's intention to
maintain, by the force of arms if necessary, this
most warlike and encompassing policy ever enunciated
by man or nation.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The Monroe Doctrine did not require that any
American possessions of the European monarchies
should be relinquished, but simply that they
should not be extended; and that, if relinquished
or lost, they should not be re-established as monarchical
possessions.</p>

<p>England, being in possession of the vast domain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of Canada in North America, British Honduras
and British Guiana in South America, and a
goodly number of the West Indian islands, was in
a position to look with favor on the Monroe Doctrine,
because in the event of Great Britain being
defeated in war by any of the Great Powers, her
victor or victors would be unable to seize any of
her American possessions, for automatically the
United States would become an ally of Great
Britain, and would, in order to defend the Monroe
Doctrine, have to defend these possessions.</p>

<p>When Sir Charles Tupper was High Commissioner
of Canada, the writer saw him in London,
and suggested to him that it would be a good idea
for the Canadians to buy some automatic guns. He
replied that Canada was very peculiarly situated;
that she could not be attacked successfully by any
Power unless the British fleet were first destroyed,
which was not likely, and, in the possible event of
that fleet being destroyed, then the United States
would be obliged to defend Canada in order to defend
the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

<p>The peace sophists often refer to the unfortified
border-line between the United States and
Canada as an argument in favor of the abolition
of armaments throughout the world. They fail to
perceive that the same unarmed condition would
not work between European countries, as, for
example, between France and Germany. If the
people of Canada and the United States were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
different in race, language, ideals, and ambitions
as are the French and Germans; and if, also, the
two countries were as thickly settled and the inhabitants
as land-hungry; and if each had a history
as antagonistic as the French and Germans;
then fortifications would be needed on the Canadian
border. But the Canadians and ourselves
are of the same race, we speak the same tongue,
we have similar ideals and ambitions, and our
history is not antagonistic; on the contrary, it has
been largely a common history&mdash;the history of
England, the mother country.</p>

<p>England and France were obligated to defend
Belgium against Germany. Their defenses consisted
mainly in bluff, but they were, nevertheless,
far better prepared to support Belgium than we
would be to support any South American country
against German aggression.</p>

<p>The navy of England is so far superior to ours
that should she at any time care to ignore the
Monroe Doctrine and colonize in South America
we should be absolutely unable to prevent her.
She would be able to isolate us from South America
and from the rest of the world, within the
continental territory of the forty-eight states. An
impenetrable barrier of British warships would lie
between us and the Panama Canal. Therefore,
it will be seen that our Monroe Doctrine is an
Anglo-American compact, an <i>entente</i>, which we
are obliged to defend if it should be in the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of Great Britain, and which Great Britain would
not be obliged to observe in case she might want
to ignore it:</p>

<p>Let us invite Admiral Mahan to conclude this
chapter:</p>

<p>"<i>In the Monroe Doctrine, as now understood,
and viewed in the light of the Venezuela incident,
with the utterances then made by our statesmen of
all parties, we have on hand one of the biggest
contracts any modern state has undertaken.</i>"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MODERN METHODS AND MACHINERY OF
WAR</h3>

<blockquote><p>"In the course of time, no one knows when or how soon, the
family of nations may get to playing at cards, and beyond the
sea, perhaps, will be found a 'full hand' against our three 'aces'&mdash;the
Navy, Coast Fortifications, and the Militia."</p>

<p>
<i>Lieut. Gen. Adna R. Chaffee, U.S.A.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Whenever a nation's attitude toward war is evasive, its conduct
indecisive, and its preparation an indifferent, orderless assembling
of forces, it prepares for defeat."</p>

<p>
<i>Homer Lea.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>In the <i>Sunday American</i> of the seventeenth of
January of this year, Mr. Andrew Carnegie
gave expression to some opinions that challenge
the attention of all thinking people of our
country who, in this trying time of war, are becoming
aroused and are asking themselves the
question: Are we adequately prepared against the
dread eventuality of war, and if not adequately
prepared, why not?</p>

<p>There is no person, of howsoever humble a
station, whose opinion has not some weight.
Horace Greeley&mdash;or was it Henry Ward Beecher?&mdash;once
said that his views upon a very important
subject underwent a material change from conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>sation
with a blacksmith while having his horse
shod.</p>

<p>The opinion of Andrew Carnegie, the greatest
steel and iron smith the world has ever known, is
certain to have great weight with a very large
number of persons, whatever the subject may be
upon which he expresses himself.</p>

<p>The world owes Andrew Carnegie a debt of deep
gratitude for many most munificent and beneficent
actions, and our gratitude to him has begotten
love for him, and our gratitude and our love beget
our sympathetic attention whenever he speaks.
Consequently, when Mr. Carnegie speaks upon the
subject of our national defense, he is bound to exercise
a tremendous power for good or evil, and
this power for good or evil is directly proportionate
to the extent that his opinions are right or
wrong.</p>

<p>At this time, the question of our national defense
is one of so serious concern that anything a
well and favorably known man says may have a
determining effect upon the minds of many persons,
and thereby be fruitful of national good
or national harm.</p>

<p>If Mr. Carnegie is right in his belief that our
best defense is in military defenselessness, then
he is doing the country a great service through the
wide publicity given to his opinions. If, on the
other hand, he is in the wrong, he is doing this
country a very great injury, and his words not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
only help defeat Congressional appropriations for
building more guns, but also help to spike the few
guns we have.</p>

<p>Let us first consider some of the more remarkable
and also the more radical of his statements.
He says, to quote:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Not one of the great nations has the slightest
desire to be other than friendly with the United
States. We are a friend to all; an enemy of none.
They could gain nothing by a war with us, nor
would we by a war with them. We have no territorial
ambitions, and only desire to be left alone.</i></p>

<p>"<i>As for this foolish talk of an invasion, that
is an impossible contingency. Imagine any country
being able to successfully bring enough troops
to accomplish anything worth while from a military
standpoint from a point three thousand miles
off and attack a hundred millions of people!</i></p>

<p>"<i>I have always said that if at any time any
country was foolish enough to attempt invasion
the best possible plan would be to make their
landing as easy as possible, point out to them
the best possible roads, and allow them to go as
far as they desired to go inland. Then warn them
to look out, and turn a million of our 16,000,000
of militia loose upon them. Getting in would be
easy, but how to get out would result in surrender.</i></p>

<p>"<i>There is no other country in the world so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
equipped to repel invasion or make it so hot for an
enemy should he land as to make him exceedingly
sorry he ever tried it.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The foregoing statements of Mr. Carnegie contain
in a nutshell the whole pith and gist of the
present anti-armament peace advocacy, backed by
the ten-million-dollar Carnegie foundation, representing
an income of half a million dollars a year.</p>

<p>Now, if it happens to be a fact that these views
of Mr. Carnegie and his coterie of peace advocates
are wrong, and if we need to take immediate
and radical measures for our national defense,
then whenever the Carnegie advocacy prevents a
battery of guns being built, the resultant injury
to the country is as great as though a battery of
our guns were to be destroyed, or as though a battery
of guns were made for a possible enemy.</p>

<p>Truly, as Mr. Carnegie states, we are friendly
to other nations, and we do not want any of their
territory, but I do not agree with him that we have
nothing which they might want, for we are both
very rich and very defenseless, and the history
of nations has shown that always the rich and
the defenseless sooner or later become the prey
of the poor and the powerful.</p>

<p>One after another of the surrounding nations
will likely be drawn into the war before it is over.
After the present belligerents have settled their
scores with the sword, there will be other scores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to be settled between the victors and the neutral
nations. Differences between the warring and
the neutral powers&mdash;differences which, in time of
peace, might produce very strained relations or
precipitate war&mdash;may now be lightly passed over
as mere discourtesies. But, after the war, some
of the acts of the neutrals that at present seem
quite insignificant may be magnified to advantage
as <i>casus belli</i>.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that, whichever side wins, the
United States will likely have to fight the winner
within a short time after the war is over, for
neither the Germans nor the Allies, in the heat
of passion that now dominates them, will be in a
mood to forgive some of the things that we may
feel compelled to do in the maintenance of our
neutrality. In short, the things that we may be
led to do to avoid being embroiled in the present
war may serve to embroil us with the victors, unless
the war should end in a draw.</p>

<p>Mr. Carnegie thinks it would be quite a difficult
undertaking for a foreign nation to land troops
enough on our shores successfully to contend with
our people. Our expert army and navy officers,
who have been educated at government expense,
and who are supposed to know about such matters,
tell us that it would be impossible for us to
mobilize and bring to the front more than 30,000
of our standing Army during the first month; and
that it would be impossible to mobilize and get our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
militia into shape to resist an army of 100,000 of
the well-trained and well-armed troops of one
of the Great Powers, inside of a year and a
half.</p>

<p>Also, our naval and military experts tell us
that it would require not only months, but years,
to get our Navy into such efficient fighting trim as
to be able to resist the navy of any one of the
leading Great Powers of the world. They tell us
that we are so short of ammunition that we might
easily exhaust the present supply in the first four
weeks of the war, and possibly in the first few
days of the war.</p>

<p>We are in the habit of speaking of our Navy
as ranking somewhere second or third from the
top. As a matter of fact, we rank much lower
than that, because of the shortage of our ammunition
supply. Just as a steam-engine cannot be
run without fuel, regardless of its size and power,
so a navy cannot be run without gunpowder.</p>

<p>When the present war broke out, France, Germany,
and England each had ten times as much
smokeless powder on hand as we had. We have
between forty and fifty million pounds of smokeless
powder at the present time, whereas we
should have 500,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The only difficulty in landing as large an army
as an enemy might desire upon our shore, would
be in overcoming our fleet. Once our fleet were
smashed, an enemy could land a hundred thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>sand
men, either on our Atlantic or on our Pacific
seaboard, long before we could mobilize the troops
we have. In fact, a quarter of a million men could
be landed before we could get the troops we have
into fighting shape.</p>

<p>Let us examine for one moment Mr. Carnegie's
proposition to welcome an army of invaders, showing
them the best roads to the interior, and then
turning lose on them a million improvised citizen
soldiers. Like Pompey, Mr. Carnegie seems
to believe that he can raise an army at will by
stamping his foot upon the ground.</p>

<p>Not only should we have to raise the million
men, but also we should have to provide small
arms, Maxim guns, rapid-fire field-cannon, and
siege howitzers for them. At least four years'
instruction and experience in the use of these
weapons would be required; furthermore, the men
would have to be imbued with the courage that
veterans have, which can be acquired only after
much experience on the firing-line; they would
have to be officered by men of military education
and training, and lastly, they would need large
corps of trained and experienced engineers, and
also a trained commissariat.</p>

<p>None of these things can be created in a day, or
a month, or made efficient in a year, so that the
army of invaders, after it had received the Carnegie
welcome and had taken possession of the
country, would have quietly to wait for us to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ready to swoop down on them, as Mr. Carnegie
suggests.</p>

<p>When the present war is over, should one of
the belligerent nations, with its veteran fighting
blood up, attack us, how are we prepared to meet
that attack?</p>

<p>Our army and navy men tell us that our position
is pathetically defenseless. They tell us that,
should our Navy be destroyed or evaded, and an
army of only a hundred thousand men, equipped
with all of the arms and paraphernalia of modern
warfare, be landed on our coast, the invading
army could go anywhere it might see fit, live off
the country, capture our big cities, and hold us
up for ransom in spite of all that we could
do.</p>

<p>What could we do? How could we flee? Where
could we flee? We simply could not flee. Most of
us have doubtless thought that if war should be
declared, we would seek safety in the interior.
But immediately war is declared, all the railroads
and all automobiles will be commandeered for
military purposes. All banks will close. All securities
will be rendered worthless, and we, reduced
to penniless hoboes, will be compelled to
stay right here and face the music.</p>

<p>Let us assume merely that an invading army of
a hundred thousand men should be landed near
New York. Should this army send out detachments
to capture the places where our arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
munitions of war are made, they would not have

<p><span class="smcap">A Rich Prize for a Hostile Army</span></p>

<p>They would find the smokeless powder works of
the United States Army and the Picatinny Arsenal,
where all the smokeless powder and high
explosives of the United States Army are stored,
near Dover, New Jersey, about thirty-five miles
from New York; also they would find there the
big naval depot for ammunition and explosives.</p>

<p>At Bridgeport, Connecticut, they would find the
Union Metallic Cartridge Works, and the American
and British Manufacturing Company's Works
for the manufacture of rapid-fire cannon, and at
New Haven they would find the Winchester Repeating
Arms and Cartridge Company's Works
and the Marlin Firearms Works. At Springfield,
Massachusetts, they would find the Smith and
Wesson Revolver Works and also the United
States Arsenal, where our rifles are made. At
Hartford, Connecticut, they would find the Colt
Patent Firearms, and the Pratt and Whitney
Works; at Ilion, New York, the Remington Small
Arms Works, and at Utica, New York, the Savage
Arms Works.</p>

<p>They would find one of our most important big-gun
factories at Troy, New York, and another
at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where also much of
our armor-plate is made. The big Cramp Shipbuilding
Works would be found at Philadelphia.
They would find at Groton, Connecticut, the factory
where all the interior parts of the Holland
submarine boats are made, and at Fore River,
Massachusetts, the big shipyard where the Holland
submarine and other war vessels are constructed.</p>

<p>They would find the Lake Submarine Torpedo
Boat Works at Bridgeport, the United States
Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode
Island, and one of our biggest navy yards, together
with the E. W. Bliss Torpedo Works, in
Brooklyn. The New York Arsenal they would
find unprotected on Governor's Island. They
would find the great duPont Smokeless Powder
Works at Carney's Point, Parlin and Pompton
Lakes, New Jersey, and at various points in New
Jersey the largest and most important high-explosives
works in the world.</p>

<p>Take a map of the United States, and a pair
of compasses, and with one point placed on the
Hudson River, at Peekskill, New York, draw
a circle having a radius of a hundred-and-sixty
miles. There will be included within that circle
all of the above-mentioned ammunition and armament
works, which constitute nearly all the smokeless
powder works, cartridge works, torpedo-boat
works, small-arms works, and big-gun and armor-plate
works in the United States. Also, this circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will include not only New York and nearby cities,
but also Boston, Albany, Syracuse, Philadelphia,
and the most important coal fields of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The conquest of this area would not be a work
of months, or of years, but only of a few days,
and the thing would be done before we had time
to mobilize the available fighting forces we have,
much less to enlist and train and arm a citizen
soldiery.</p>

<p>This vital area is the solar plexus of Uncle Sam,
and an army of a hundred thousand trained men,
landed on our Atlantic seaboard, would be able
to capture this entire area and subdue the populace
as easily as the police force of New York
can subdue a rioting mob.</p>

<p>While we were arming and training our million
men to make the Carnegie swoop, the army of invaders
would be very busy.</p>

<p>They would commandeer all our above-mentioned
factories, and proceed to operate them with
skilled American labor, which they would also commandeer
and force to work, just as the Germans
have forced the Belgians to work for them, and
Mr. Carnegie's army of citizen soldiers would
find themselves without means either of arming
themselves or of supplying themselves with ammunition
or of getting the skilled labor necessary
to do the work.</p>

<p>But this is not all that the invaders would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
doing while we were getting our million men together.
They would have means of knowing what
we were doing, and they would send out a detachment
and defeat our whole enterprise. They
would probably levy on New York City for a billion
dollars, and levy upon all the cities in the
captured area for every dollar that could be
squeezed from the inhabitants under threats of
destruction.</p>

<p>Not only this, but they might take the notion,
and probably would take the notion, to annex the
conquered territory, just as Germany has annexed
Belgium, and, as we should then automatically
become citizens of the enemy's country, we should
be conscripted and forced to fight our own people,
just as the Belgians, according to report, have
been forced into the ranks of the Germans.</p>

<p>Such a military measure is not new; it is as old
as war itself. Frederick the Great frequently
forced his prisoners to fight in his own ranks, and
Napoleon Bonaparte sometimes gave them the
option of joining his legions or of faring much
worse. Attila took with him the entire male population
of the countries through which he passed as
additions to his military host. Those who resisted
were immediately killed, and those he did
not need were killed, whether they resisted or not.
As to what may be done in war, there is no arbiter
but necessity.</p>

<p>To receive an invading army is not so pleasant a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thing as Mr. Carnegie assumes. As guests they
are just about as lovable and make just about as
good pets in the family as rattlesnakes, cobras,
scorpions, and tarantulas.</p>

<p>A few Americans who were caught in the war
zone when the present war broke out got some
useful knowledge of war's inconveniences and
harassments. What the people for whom there
was no escape suffered in Belgium and Northern
France, is beyond our powers of conception. No
one who has not had personal experience can form
the least idea of the barbarous atrocities perpetrated
by an invading army on the defenseless
population.</p>

<p>Invaders always live off the invaded country.
It is considered more important that they should
live well than that any one else should live at all.
If, after the invaders' wants are supplied, there is
enough left for the people to live on, well and
good; if not, then the people must starve. The
invaders must have food and clothing and the bare
necessaries of life; also, they must have luxuries.
They must have cigars and cigarettes, wine,
women, and song. If our country should be invaded,
we should not only have to furnish food,
clothing, cigars, cigarettes, and wine for the
armies of the enemy, but also our wives and our
daughters and our sweethearts would be commandeered
to supply the women and song.</p>

<p>Occasionally, an American citizen, with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
manhood than discretion, would resent a nameless
indignity, and kill some military blackguard,
who would immediately be avenged by the burning
of the town and the corralling and shooting
of the people with machine-guns. This is not an
overdrawn picture&mdash;the thing has actually been
done in the present war.</p>

<p>It is very likely that some of us who look upon
this page will be forced to see wife or daughter or
sweetheart namelessly maltreated to gratify the
brutal lust of an invader, and lose our own life
for a blow on the scoundrel's jaw or a stab in
his ribs, unless&mdash;aye, there's the rub&mdash;unless this
whole country awakens to its danger and rises up
as one man and demands prompt and adequate
defensive measures for national protection. As
this saving thing is not likely to happen, the
entire country east of the Alleghanies will probably
be Belgiumized with fire and the sword, depredated,
degraded, and desolated by an invading
army within a very short time after the European
War is over.</p>

<p>This is an age of mechanics&mdash;an age wherein
man-made mechanism more and more replaces
hand work. Everywhere in our industries of
peace, we have seen labor-saving machinery replace
the labor of human hands. Today all the
men in the world could not do by hand all of the
world's ploughing, sowing, reaping, and carrying
of the world's food to market; all the women in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the world could not, today, do the world's sewing
without the sewing-machine; and all the men in
the world and all the women in the world combined
could not, today, do a tenth of the world's
writing without the typewriter and type-setting
and printing machinery.</p>

<p>One of the giant dredges that have been ladling
out of the Panama Canal the vast landslides, can
do the pick and shovel and wheelbarrow work of
a thousand men. Everywhere, in everything we
do, and in everything done for us, we find human
hands now mainly engaged in guiding the work of
labor-saving machinery.</p>

<p>The people of the United States of America
have been able to develop their enormous resources
and to keep abreast of the world's industrial
progress mainly by the invention of labor-saving
machinery under the protection of our
patent law.</p>

<p>In our competition with other nations for the
markets of the world, no one thinks of referring
to the prowess of our unskilled citizen soldiers of
industry unsupported by machinery, but all reliance
is placed upon our multiform labor-saving
machinery, and our skilled labor behind that
machinery.</p>

<p>With these pregnant facts before us, it is very
strange that it should not be perfectly plain to
every one that what is true of labor-saving machinery
in peace is likewise true in war. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
very strange indeed that there should be intelligent
men and women among us unable to see and
to understand that labor-saving machinery and
labor skilled in its use are as applicable and as
indispensable to successful warfare as to peaceful
industry. Furthermore, labor-saving machinery
in war is life-saving machinery. The quick-firing
gun is the greatest life-saving instrument ever invented.
These persons do not seem to appreciate
that war is an industry. As a matter of stern
fact, war is, and has always been, the biggest and
the most vital industry of mankind, and in no
other industry is labor-saving machinery so important
and so vital, and in no other industry
does so much depend upon the skill of the labor
operating the machinery.</p>

<p>We are the slaves of belief, and we love our
chains. Although our faith may be false, we hate
the hand that tries to free us. The people of this
country have a great false faith in the fighting
qualities of their citizen soldiery, improvised in
time of war. They point proudly to the War of
the Revolution and the War of the Rebellion to
prove how our volunteer soldiers can fight. They
overlook the fact that fighting was then mostly
done by hand; that now it is mostly done by machinery,
and that it is just as foolish and absurd
to think of taking untrained men off the farm
to operate the guns and machinery of war as it
would be to try to operate the factories with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
where the guns and machinery are made. It takes
as long today to convert a farmer into a skilled
soldier as it does to convert him into a skilled
mechanic.</p>

<p>Battles are no longer decided merely by the
patriotism and personal bravery of the rank and
file, nor even by their numbers, but by the efficiency
and sufficiency of machinery and materials
of destruction and the science and scientific experience
of the commanding officers. There is
no time to build steam-fire-engines or to train
fire brigades after a conflagration has broken
out.</p>

<p>A citizen soldiery without years of training in
the discipline and weapons and mechanism of
modern warfare is only a mob, as easily scattered
by a few real soldiers as chaff by a whirlwind.</p>

<p>George Washington held the following opinion
about the value of militia in warfare:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Regular troops alone are equal to the exigencies
of modern war, as well for defense as offense,
and when a substitute is attempted it must prove
illusory and ruinous. No militia will ever acquire
the habits necessary to resist a regular force ...
the firmness requisite for the real business of
fighting is only to be attained by a constant course
of discipline and service. I have never yet been
witness to a single instance that can justify a different
opinion, and it is most earnestly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
wished that the liberties of America may no longer
be trusted, in any material degree, to so precarious
a dependence.</i>"&mdash;<i>Washington.</i></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>If Washington held it a mistake to rely on untrained,
undisciplined men in time of war, who
can differ with him today, when not only bravery
and discipline are required, but also a knowledge
of the complicated enginery of warfare?</p>

<p>It is obvious to any one that ten men armed
with the modern magazine shoulder-rifle, with a
range of more than two miles, would easily be able
to defeat a thousand men&mdash;a hundred times their
number&mdash;armed with slings and bows and arrows,
short-swords and spears, as was the army of Hannibal.
Hannibal's famous Balearic slingers were
able to hurl a slug of lead through a man. But ten
riflemen would have time to kill a thousand of them
before they could get within sling range. A thousand
of the famous English bowmen who fought
at Agincourt could all be destroyed by our
ten riflemen before they could get within bowshot.</p>

<p>The same thing holds equally true with old
short-range and obsolete firearms, as compared
with the longer range and more accurate guns of
the latest pattern. Ten good marksmen, armed
with the latest rifles, could kill a thousand equally
skilled marksmen armed with the old muzzle-loaders
of the Civil War, before they could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
within range. These ten men would each be able
to fire with ease a carefully aimed shot every two
and a half seconds; the ten men could fire 250
aimed shots a minute. A thousand men, armed
with the old muzzle-loaders, would surely have to
advance at least a mile and a half after coming
within range of the modern rifles before they could
get the ten riflemen within range of their muzzle-loaders.
Charging forward on the run, it would
take them at least ten minutes to cover the mile
and a half. In that time the ten riflemen would
be able to fire 2,500 carefully-aimed shots. Such
is the difference in the potentiality of troops dependent
upon suitable arms.</p>

<p>With the modern automatic magazine-rifle a
single soldier would be able to defeat a hundred
men armed with the old smooth-bore single-shot
muzzle-loaders of the Civil War; in fact, he would
be able to kill or wound every one of them in an
open frontal attack over level ground with his
long-range rapid-fire rifle before they could get
near enough even to reach him with their short-range
muskets. One man operating an automatic
machine-gun would be more than a match for a
thousand men, armed with the old Civil War musket
in an open-view frontal attack, over a distance
covered by the range of the machine gun. In fact,
with this weapon, firing 600 shots a minute, he
could play the gun on their advancing line with the
freedom of a hose pipe, and put them <i>hors de</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<i>combat</i> in a few minutes&mdash;certainly, before they
could get near enough to reach him with their
short-range guns.</p>

<p>Half a dozen automatic machine-guns supported
by a battery of half a dozen modern rapid-fire
field-guns throwing shrapnel shell at the rate
of from thirty to forty a minute, planted on Cemetery
Hill, would have been able to defeat Pickett's
charge at Gettysburg more quickly than did the
entire Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that a nation's war potentiality
depends very largely upon its preparedness
to fight by machinery, and that a mere citizen
soldiery, without the machinery of modern
warfare, is as impotent in the face of modern war
engines as a swarm of ants in the face of an anteater.
It is obvious that, whereas fighting machinery
is very expensive, modern warfare is a
very costly business, and a business requiring an
enormous investment; and also that, whereas a
thing is worth most in war which can, for the
least cost, produce the best results, machinery becomes
much more valuable than life. A single
field-piece may be worth more than a hundred
men, and at times even more than a thousand
men.</p>

<p>In modern warfare, the cost in treasure and machinery
is of far greater concern than the loss in
blood. Therefore, the efficiency and great cost of
all kinds of modern fighting equipment have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
served to give the great nations pause, and to
make them consider well the awful risk before precipitating
war. The progress in fighting machinery
of every sort has been so rapid, and the
number of wars so few, that until now there has
been no adequate opportunity to test fighting
machinery in actual warfare.</p>

<p>In direct proportion as warfare becomes more
scientific, complicated, and expensive does it require
longer time to prepare for war, both in the
making of the enginery and in the making of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Time signifies only the measure of change.
Consequently, time is merely a relative term, indicative
of the sequence in a series of happenings
or eventuations. If the universe were annihilated,
there would be no such thing as time because nothing
would happen.</p>

<p>Were we to be attacked by any foreign Power,
we should be able to rely, not upon what we might
be able to produce three or four years afterward,
but upon what we should be able to put into action
at once. Modern methods and machinery of war
cause events to move many times as fast as in
former wars. Three months is a long time after
war is declared. A six months' war today is relatively
as long as a six years' war used to be.</p>

<p>The following extract from Bernhardi's "How
Germany Makes War" is evidence of that expert's
opinion of the factor of time:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>If Germany is involved in war, she need not
recoil before the numerical superiority of her enemies.
But so far as human nature is able to tell,
she can only rely on being successful if she is resolutely
determined to break the superiority of her
enemies by a victory over one or the other of them
before their total strength can come into action,
and if she prepares for war to that effect, and acts
at the decisive moment in that spirit which made
Frederick the Great seize the sword against a
world in arms.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Napoleon once said, "The fate of nations often
hangs on five minutes," and, "God fights on the
side of the heaviest artillery." Also, he said, in
effect, that the art of winning battles depends
upon the concentration on the chief point of attack
of a force superior to the enemy at that point.</p>

<p>If we pass our finger down the pages of history,
we shall find the above expression of Napoleon
thoroughly substantiated and vindicated. Most
great battles have been won by the concentration
of a superior force upon an inferior force at some
vulnerable point, and often quite irrespective of
the sizes of the opposing armies taken as a whole.
Everything depends upon the quickness in concentration
of concerted action. The herculean
physique of Goliath did not count for much after
little David hit him with the pebble. He needs be
a big man indeed not to be whipped when even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
small antagonist has succeeded in thrusting a dagger
close to the heart. Armies, like individuals,
have vital parts, the penetration of which means
defeat.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great frequently met and annihilated
armies many times larger than his own.
He was often weaker than the enemy as a whole,
but at the point of attack he was always vastly the
stronger. This enabled him to crush the enemy in
detail. Hannibal, Cæsar, Charles Martel, Marlborough,
Cromwell, Frederick the Great, Napoleon,
Grant, Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Sheridan&mdash;all
great captains&mdash;appreciated and applied this
winning principle: Be able to strike the enemy
upon one given point with greater force than he
shall be able to oppose, and strike first; then
follow up the advantage and crush the enemy in
detail by concentrated force always superior at
the point of attack, however inferior to the general
force to which it is opposed and through
which it penetrates.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the machinery of modern
warfare adds a thousand-fold to the potentiality
of the soldier in battle above his potentiality at
the time of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Ten thousand men, armed with modern guns
and all the paraphernalia of modern warfare,
would on the battle-line be more than a match for
a million men armed with the old smooth-bore
guns of the Civil War. As a matter of fact they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
could kill all that surrounded them as fast as they
approached from every quarter, and they could
advance through the opposing lines with absolute
freedom without the loss of a single man from the
fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Let us see for one moment what ten thousand
men would be able to do upon such a host in open
frontal attack: Let us assume that the ten thousand
were armed with a thousand automatic
guns, and, say, a hundred rapid-fire field-guns,
in addition to the usual magazine shoulder-rifle.
As soon as the enemy came in sight, the ten thousand
would open on them with their hundred field-guns,
pouring into their ranks a perfect storm of
shrapnel. The old, smooth-bore field-guns of the
enemy would be completely disabled before they
could be brought within cannon-shot of the ten
thousand. As soon as the enemy came within
rifle range, the ten thousand would open on them
with their thousand automatic machine-guns and
magazine-rifles. As an automatic machine-gun
fires at the rate of 600 shots a minute, a thousand
would fire at the rate of 600,000 shots a minute.
The magazine shoulder-rifles would fire aimed shots
at the rate of twenty-five a minute, and the quick-firing
field-guns would each fire shrapnel at the
rate of forty a minute. Making every allowance
for stoppages and for variables, dispersion of fire
and bad marksmanship, there would be enough effectual
hits with the shrapnel, the automatic ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>chine-gun
fire, and the magazine-rifle fire, to kill
or wound every man of the enemy before that
enemy could get near enough to reach the ten
thousand with their old smooth-bore muskets.</p>

<p>Every automatic gun and every quick-firing
field-gun and every magazine shoulder-rifle puts
in the hands of our soldiers the means of avoiding
a corresponding sacrifice of their lives. Not only
this, but every automatic gun that we make and
furnish our troops enables one man to do the
work of a hundred men; it enables a hundred
men to remain at home engaged in peaceful pursuits
while only one man has to go to the battle
front and fight.</p>

<p>Then let us realize the fact that every automatic
gun saves a hundred lives from jeopardy. Every
magazine-rifle saves ten lives, and every quick-firing
field-cannon saves easily a hundred lives.</p>

<p>This should make a strong appeal to the professional
pacifists who pretend that they want to
save life. Surely, if war cannot be prevented,
and all history, and the present moment as well,
prove that it cannot, then we should make it as
merciful as possible, and fight it in a way that will
cause as little sacrifice of life as possible.</p>

<p>In estimating the cost of war in human lives, we
cannot count values that may be placed upon them
by sentiments of humanity, but only such values
as, when destroyed, make the losing nation economically
so much the poorer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>According to I. S. Bloch, a new-born child of
the farming class has a value of twenty-five dollars.
At five years of age, he has a value of two
hundred and fifty dollars; at ten years of age, he
is worth about five hundred dollars; at fifteen, he
is worth almost a thousand dollars; and at twenty,
he is worth a little more than a thousand dollars.
His maximum value is at twenty, and he begins
to depreciate in value as he grows older, because
of his shortened days of service.</p>

<p>Therefore, the average economic value of soldiers
may, according to Mr. Bloch, be put at a
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>According to David Starr Jordan, it costs about
fifteen thousand dollars for each soldier killed in
battle, so that, according to these two eminent
peace advocates and peace propagandists, when
the Germans slay, say, a thousand of the Allies,
the loss to the Allies is the value of the thousand
men, namely, a million dollars, and as it costs the
Germans fifteen times as much to kill them as they
are worth, the loss to the Germans is fifteen million
dollars; so that the actual German loss is fifteen
times as great as that of the Allies. But
as the Allies are killing a good many Germans,
they are generously sharing with the Germans a
fair proportion of the cost of the war.</p>

<p>These figures are not far out of the way.
The fact is that, in modern warfare, the actual
loss of life for the numbers engaged is cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>respondingly
less than it used to be, while the
cost is correspondingly greater. In modern warfare,
the loss of money is far greater than the
loss of life. It is more the dollar than blood, that
is now shed.</p>

<p>In ancient times, when men fought hand to hand
in compact form, with short-sword, spear, and
battle-axe, they used often to slay half the numbers
engaged&mdash;easily ten times as many for the
numbers engaged as are now slain. There are
more than ten million Allies now under arms
against more than seven million Germans and
Austrians. These numbers have not as yet all
been brought face to face with one another on the
line of battle, owing to modern methods of warfare;
but under old-time methods with old-time
arms, they would have been at once brought into
collision in two enormous armies. In ancient
times, less mobilization could be effected in a year
than can now be effected in a month, but when the
collision came, the issue of the war was decided
on one great field.</p>

<p>If these great European armies were armed
with short-swords, spears, and battle-axes, as
armies used to be, instead of with modern war
weapons and enginery, they would, during the
time they have been engaged, very likely have
slain a third of their number&mdash;certainly ten times
as many in proportion to the numbers engaged
as have actually been killed in the present war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Even a tenth of their numbers would be a million
and a half.</p>

<p>Never in all history have such vast numbers of
men been drawn up in line of battle. Never have
they been so scientifically armed, and, consequently,
never have they, for the numbers engaged,
killed so few.</p>

<p>Modern machine-guns and quick-firing guns,
with bullets and shrapnel and canister, are so
deadly that troops in mass form cannot live for a
minute in front of them, but as opposing armies
with modern war machinery line up at the present
greater tactical distances, and throw out their
men in long-extended battle-lines, and spread them
over correspondingly wide areas, the fight becomes
one largely of gun against gun, engine
against engine, with the result that not nearly so
many lives are lost as there would be if the fighting
were done by hand, and hand to hand, in close
order. The German siege guns smashed the forts
of Liège and Namur from a distance of nine
miles.</p>

<p>As nations are bound to fight, it is far more
merciful that they should be armed to the teeth,
but it is vastly more expensive. Can we not afford,
however, to spend dollars instead of men to
kill our enemies?</p>

<p>Therefore, even according to the facts and figures
of those two eminent peace-men, I. S.
Bloch and Dr. David Starr Jordan, the money loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
today is a concern fifteen times more serious to
the economic welfare of a nation than is the loss in
lives.</p>

<p>It is a very strange paradox indeed that the
professional peace-propagandists, who claim to be
actuated mainly by considerations of humanity,
should advocate disarmament and the inevitable
reversion to the old and more deadly arms and
methods of warfare, on account of the greater expensiveness
of warfare conducted with modern
scientific arms and methods.</p>

<p>By doing away with our present highly scientific
and very expensive war enginery and fighting
methods, the nations would be able, in a war like
the present, to kill one another at very much less
cost. They would then be able to kill ten times
as many in a given time, while the cost would be
only a small fraction of the present cost.</p>

<p>It is a matter of solemn certainty that the quick-firing
gun is the most beneficent implement of
mercy that has ever been invented, and every
peace advocate in the world and every lover of
his kind should appreciate this fact and use his
influence in favor of armaments which serve to
make war expensive, and tend both to prevent
war, and to save life when war comes.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment suppose that the great
European Powers had disarmed fifteen years ago
when the Czar of Russia broached the subject to
them. What would have been the result? This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
war would have come just the same, and probably
much sooner; and it would have been ten-fold more
bloody, even had the nations flung themselves
upon one another armed with scythes, carving-knives,
wood-axes, and common tools of trade, or
even had they fought, as the simple cave men did,
with clubs and stones.</p>

<p>Love of home and country&mdash;patriotism&mdash;on the
one hand, and race hatred on the other, are far
more potent in the human heart than any lately
created sentiments of international brotherhood
and humanity. Before this war came, it was a
common preachment of the peace-men and a common
belief of the multitude, that many socialists,
members of brotherhoods of labor and other opponents
of war, would refuse to fight, and if
drafted would shoot down their officers from the
rear. But nothing of this kind has happened.
When this war broke out, socialist, labor unionist,
and preacher of international brotherhood joined
with their militant fellow-countrymen in singing
the "Marseillaise," "Wacht am Rhein," "Britannia
Rules the Waves," and rushed to arms and
to war, and are now fighting like demons, shoulder
to shoulder with the imperialist and the war lord.</p>

<p>In order that we may be made as right-seeking
as possible, God has ordained the trials of strife
and hardship which force us to get busy, and
thereby develop our usefulness. Human duty may
be expressed in the following terms: The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
preparation for the attainment of success in life
is the acquisition of a thorough realization of the
fact that no one deserves more from the world
than he earns out of it, and that the bigness or
littleness of any one is exactly proportionate to
his use to the world, and that, consequently, actual
self-service is impossible except indirectly through
world-service.</p>

<p>Whatever may be done in the service of an individual
to help him attain success and find comfort,
or to lessen his discomfort, may not be best
for the general good, because individual welfare
must, in the end of things, be subservient to the
general welfare.</p>

<p>It sometimes becomes perfectly right and proper
that individual life should be sacrificed for national
life, but never national life for individual
life. The nation has, however, its obligations to
the individual, and obligations as exacting as
those of the individual to the nation. If a nation
does not exercise due and reasonable diligence
to safeguard its people against war and does not
provide itself with the necessary trained men and
machinery to forefend war, then the obligation
of the individual to the nation in the event of war
is just so much lessened. The leading of an untrained
and ill-armed, improvised citizen soldiery
against an army of trained veterans, with all of
the equipment of modern warfare, results in useless,
senseless slaughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>If a nation does not prepare itself to demand
and enforce respectful treatment of its citizens
in foreign countries, then its citizens should have
no patriotism, for they are like men and women
without a country. But when a nation is armed
with guns, and armed with the purpose to defend
its citizens, wherever they may be, to the last
man and last pinch of gunpowder, and is so adequately
prepared with labor-saving, life-saving
machinery that in the event of war the minimum
of human sacrifice shall be made, then it is the
duty of every man to place himself unreservedly
at the service of his country.</p>

<p>If the people of this country could be roused to
a realization of what invasion means, there would
be no longer heard any senseless prating about
an unarmed peace, but the whole people would
rise in their might and demand adequate armaments
and an adequate army and navy, and the
senseless peace fanatics would be burned in effigy.</p>

<p>We have for half a century listened with confidence
to the assurance that we are so splendidly
isolated by broad seas that we need not fear invasion.</p>

<p>Our inadequate Navy is today the only bulwark
against invasion, for modern means of transportation
over seas have reduced the ocean to a ferry.</p>

<p>Both England and Germany have navies superior
to our own, and would be able to destroy
our Navy, and land on our unfortified shores a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hundred thousand men in less than two weeks&mdash;half
the time that would be required for us to
mobilize our little Army of thirty thousand men.</p>

<p>Japan is not so far away as she used to be. She
has been rapidly narrowing the Pacific, and she
could land a quarter of a million men on the Pacific
coast in less than a month, much quicker
than we could get our thirty thousand regulars
there to receive them.</p>

<p>We are no longer splendidly isolated from other
nations. We are isolated only from ourselves,
and we are truly splendidly isolated in that particular.</p>

<p>The other nations are isolated only by such
time and difficulty as they would have to encounter
in order to bring veteran troops to our shores,
with all the necessary equipment of war, and, as
we have seen, this is an isolation of less than a
month, while we are isolated by unpreparedness
by at least fifty months, for it would take more
than four years, if we should start now, to raise,
equip, and train an army that would compare in
numbers, equipment, and training with the army
that any one of the Great Powers could place upon
our shores in a month.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Secretary of War Garrison
said:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>If tomorrow any first-class military power
should attack the United States in force and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
should succeed in getting her warships and soldier-laden
transports past our fleet, landed out of
range of our coast defenses, once fairly ashore she
could pulverize our small regular army and punish
us to a humiliating degree, if not actually make us
sue for peace, before we could raise and train a
volunteer army adequate to cope with the invaders.
In other words, at present our navy is
our only considerable bulwark against invasion.
Even such part of our militia as we could depend
on and the available regular army would make an
extremely small force, our army being in size only
a local police force, well trained and highly efficient
indeed, but in numbers little more than twice
the size of the police force of New York City&mdash;that
is, not large enough for our great country
even as a mere police force.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Let us, for argument's sake, assume for a moment
that we were to be invaded with an army of
only a hundred thousand men, trained, equipped,
and supplied with the supreme adequacy with
which the troops of the other Great Powers are
trained, equipped, and supplied.</p>

<p>The enemy would line up in a battle-front three
times as long as our little thirty thousand could
be stretched with equal powers of concentration,
or if our thirty thousand were to be stretched
out a hundred miles we should be at least
three times as weak as the enemy at any point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of attack, even were our thirty thousand to be
as well equipped and as well supplied as the
troops of the enemy. But we should be without
the requisite field artillery, and the artillery
that we should have would be without the
requisite training. We should be without the
needed cavalry, and our cavalry would be without
proper organization and experience. We should
be without ammunition trains, and very short of
ammunition. Our troops, hustled together, and
rushed to the front for the first time to face a
real enemy, would be unprepared to behave like
an army, and, what is very important, they would
have no hope of success.</p>

<p>Despair would be in the heart of every man.
Both officers and men would know that there were
no ready resources, no reserves and reserve supplies
behind them, and no adequate arrangements
for providing any. Every man of the thirty thousand
would know that he was being sacrificed in
atonement for national blundering, just as at
Balaklava the noble Six Hundred were by a blunder
sacrificed in the charge of the Light Brigade.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Preponderance of Gun-fire</span></p>

<p>It is strange how little the law of battles is
understood by most persons. Most persons
imagine that in a fight between our Navy and another
navy, or between our Army and the army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
an enemy, although the enemy might have the
advantage in the number of ships and in the size
and range of guns, the advantage would be immaterial
and one which might be balanced by the
superiority of our personnel, and that, although
we might be somewhat short of the required field
batteries and ammunition, the superior fighting
qualities of our men would render them more than
a match for the enemy, even in the face of superior
gun-fire.</p>

<p>It does not appear to have been fully recognized
even by the advocates of better equipment for the
American Army, how vitally important is length
of range in field artillery.</p>

<p>In the Boer War, the British field batteries
found themselves at great disadvantage in face
of the longer French guns of the Boer batteries.</p>

<p>In the present European war, the great long-range
German howitzers, pummeling forts into
heaps of scrap, and their plunging fire blowing
great craters along the battle-front, spread terror
in the ranks of the Allies, similar to the terror
that the Romans felt when the fierce Gothic giants
slid down the Alps into the vineyards of Italy.
But the long-range French field-artillery soon restored
confidence, for it was found that the French
field batteries could outrange the German batteries.</p>

<p>We need field-guns of longer range. We need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
field-guns that shall not only equal in range those
now in use in Europe, but also we need guns of
even longer range. We should have field-guns of
a range sufficient to command sky-line from opposing
sky-line. Here is an opportunity for the
vaunted American genius to assert itself.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the facts as they actually
are should be recognized and appreciated.</p>

<p>Victory in a naval battle today depends absolutely
upon the weight of the broadsides and the
speed of the vessels, which enables them to man&oelig;uvre
and choose positions of advantage with
respect to the enemy; while victory or defeat in a
land fight depends upon the weight of gun-fire,
which can be directed against the positions of an
enemy.</p>

<p>The actual number of infantry engaged is of
secondary importance. It is artillery that is of
supreme importance. Should we be involved, our
field artillery must pave the way with the dead
bodies of the enemy before our infantry can advance.
Also, the batteries of the enemy must be
silenced by our own batteries before they, with
their gun-fire, shall be able to silence ours.
Other things being equal, therefore, it is the number
of field batteries that, more than anything else,
turns the tide of battle for defeat or victory. If
the enemy's guns have a longer range than ours,
then they will be able to silence our batteries while
far beyond the range of our guns. They will be
able to destroy our artillery, while we should not
be able even to injure theirs.</p>

<span class="caption">Relative Numerical Strength of Field Artillery</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us picture a land fight:</p>

<p>Our aërial scouts inform us that the enemy is
approaching, and that they have already mounted
their long-range field artillery on a convenient
ridge; also that they have placed their big howitzers
on an adjoining lowland under the concealment
of a wood, and that this formation is repeated
in similar units from ridge to ridge and
hill to hill over a front a hundred miles in length.</p>

<p>The enemy has also dug long lines of trenches
far in advance of their artillery. The enemy's
position is well beyond the range of our artillery.
We are unable to reach the enemy's position with
our guns, while the enemy, being provided with
guns of much longer range, is able to storm our
position along our entire front, and to throw
shrapnel shell into the trenches filled with our
men, which stretch along the lowland in front of
our positions. We try to dig additional trenches
to advance our front, but the men sent to do the
work are very quickly killed by the shrapnel fire
of the enemy.</p>

<p>We see with our field-glasses that the enemy has
sent out detachments to advance the line of their
trenches. We fire at them, and find that our
shrapnel falls far short. The enemy, seeing this,
advances and digs trenches close up to the limit of
the range of our guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once, the enemy opens fire with shrapnel
upon our entire line of trenches, and with shrapnel
and howitzers upon all our fortified positions.
We return the fire, but without any effect; the
range of our guns being too short to reach the
enemy. Many of our guns are quickly silenced.
The perfect hurricane of shrapnel thrown upon
our trenches has killed large numbers of our men
and confounded the remainder.</p>

<p>The infantry of the enemy now advances pell-mell
over the intervening space, still under cover
of artillery fire. Field batteries of the enemy
also advance rapidly and take up new positions.</p>

<p>Finding our positions untenable, our army retreats
precipitately, taking with it a few remaining
guns, and our men re-form their batteries on
commanding positions to cover our retreat, but
they are soon dislodged by the long-range guns
of the enemy. Finally, our army takes up its
stand far in the rear, forming a new battle-front,
which has been previously fortified.</p>

<p>The enemy advances, repeats the previous tactics,
forming a long battle-front on commanding
positions just beyond the range of our guns, and
again proceeds to dislodge us, and drive us back
by their long-range gun-fire.</p>

<p>Our loss in men and guns has been enormous.
The enemy, on the contrary, has lost no guns, and
but few men.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the enemy can very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
proceed in this manner into the interior, and conquer
the whole country without suffering very
much discomfiture, unless we have guns of as long
or longer range than the enemy has, and as many
of them, also as many skilled troops to operate
them.</p>

<p>Most persons imagine that infantry, armed with
the modern long-range magazine-rifles, can go
into battle, and shoot large numbers of an enemy,
and that, if the infantry is numerous and daring
enough and brave enough, they will be able to whip
the enemy without the support of field artillery.
This is a grave error. An army of a million men,
consisting entirely of infantry, armed with modern
shoulder-arms, would be completely over-matched
and easily defeated by an army of 25,000
men amply equipped with modern field artillery.
The infantry would be wholly unable to get within
musket-range, because they would all be destroyed
by the shrapnel of the enemy before they could
get near enough to fire a single effective shot.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand English, Germans, or
Japanese, equipped with the longest and best
modern field artillery, with plenty of ammunition
and supply trains, air-scouts and engineer corps,
could, in our present defenseless condition, march
through this country as Xenophon's ten thousand
marched through ancient Persia. They could cut
their way through all opposition that we could
offer. We have neither the infantry, nor the ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>tillery,
nor the cavalry, to oppose them, and the
artillery we have is of so much shorter range that
at no time could we get near enough to the enemy
to reach him with our guns.</p>

<p>If war comes between us and any of the Great
Powers, the splendid young men of the country&mdash;husbands,
fathers, sons, brothers, lovers&mdash;will
have to go to the front and meet the invaders.</p>

<p>If they go forward equipped with the necessary
arms, ammunition, and enginery of war, and
are well trained and well officered, then they will
be able not only to hold their own against the invaders,
with comparatively little loss of life, but
also to repel and drive out the enemy and save our
land from spoliation and our homes from despoliation.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, they are to be sent forward
without the necessary arms, ammunition,
and enginery, and without training, and incompetently
or incompletely officered, as the pacifist
propagandists and other sentimentalists are advising
and planning that they be sent, then they
will go just like lambs to the slaughter.</p>

<p>The zone of fire in front of the enemy's trenches
will be heaped high, acres wide and miles long,
with their dead bodies; and writhing, groaning,
shrieking, agonized forms of the wounded will
crawl over and under the dead toward the hope
of safety and mercy.</p>

<p>Into such a hell are the hyper-sentimental peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sophists planning to send those you most love,
those to whom you most cling, and on whom you
most depend; and you are aiding and abetting the
crime if you believe the words of these false reasoners.</p>

<p>Every word you aim against necessary preparedness
for war may, in the final reckoning, aim
a gun at the heart of him whom you love more
than all the world; and you might be able to say
a word that would protect him with a gun.</p>

<p>That human attribute which, more than any
other, distinguishes man from the brute, is imagination.
Also, it is the attribute which, more than
any other, differentiates the normal man from the
criminal. If, in imagination, a would-be murderer
could foresee the distorted face and the
despairing agony of his dying victim, and could
foresee the tear-streaming eyes of those mourning
for him, he would, unless brazened against every
feeling of pity, stay his hand. If those who,
through their ignorance, false belief, or hypocrisy
and desire for publicity, are planning to sacrifice
the unimaginable thousands of our best young
men in the bloody shambles of war, as an offering
to false faith, vanity, or hypocrisy, could only
foresee in imagination the long lines of manhood
swept and annihilated by the withering fire of
an enemy, without guns to return that fire, then
possibly they might submerge personal limelight-lust
for considerations of mercy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>If you believe them, and speak as they are
speaking, and advise as they are advising, against
adequate national defense, you should at once
change your belief, and use your voice and every
resource at your command in future to forefend
this country and avert the great useless sacrifice.</p>

<p>Come, young lady reader, let us, in imagination,
stand together on the firing-line: Those regiments
lining up are from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Massachusetts. They are forming for a
charge. It is the only way. Those shells, bursting
among them with such deadly effect, are shrapnel
from the quick-firing guns of the enemy placed
just over the crest of yonder distant ridge; and
those huge plunging projectiles, which throw up
great inverted cones of earth, with fragments of
men, are from the enemy's big howitzers, located
under cover of the wood that fringes the horizon.</p>

<p>If we only had the necessary quick-firing field-guns
and shrapnel ammunition, and the necessary
field howitzers, we might dislodge or silence those
deadly batteries of the enemy. At any rate, we
should be able to engage them efficiently and
cover the charge of our troops. We should also
be able to storm that line of trenches, to the
discomfiture of the enemy hidden there in vast
numbers, and thus to prepare for the onset of
our men. But we have neither the guns nor the
ammunition.</p>

<p>See&mdash;the order is given. Onward they go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Watch them, the brave fellows! Why does the
front line lie down so suddenly, with a few left
standing? My friend, they are not lying down;
they are dead. But they are not all killed, a large
number of them are wounded. They are torn in
every inconceivable, horrible manner of mutilation.
And look!&mdash;the other lines go down, too;
some lying still, others writhing on the ground.
One of those poor devils, with hands clenched in
the grass and gnawing the earth, is your brother!</p>

<p>See&mdash;a huge howitzer shell explodes right
among them. The young man whom you were to
marry on his return from the war was standing on
the verge of the crater when the explosion came,
and he is now lying there, with both eyes blown
out by the awful blast and hanging on his cheeks.
There are visions of you in the blasted eyes, and
there are thoughts of you in the dazed brain, and
his dying breath is a whisper of your name.</p>

<p>Will you continue to think thoughts and speak
words which may drive him to that awful death?</p>

<p>The picture is horrible. That of the blasted
eyes is revolting. True, and for this reason it
may not come within the artistic, as outlined
in the philosophy of Longinus; but it is not my
purpose here to be artistic. My very purpose is
to visualize the horrible, because the only way
for the people of this country to prevent this on-coming
horror is to make the necessary military
preparations for national defense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But, young lady, this is not the end of the
dreadful picture: Let us look into your home.
The awful news comes&mdash;our men are beaten with
enormous slaughter; father, brother, sweetheart&mdash;all
your home's defenders&mdash;are dead. The invaders
who have murdered them are in the street
outside. There comes a summons at the door. A
certain number of the enemy have been billeted to
your house, and you must play the genial hostess.
Though they get drunk, and ill-treat you beyond
the power of words to tell, there remains no
remedy. Your dear ones, who were your natural
defenders, have been sacrificed on the altar of
false faith in defenselessness as a deterrent of
war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<i>February 6th, 1915.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Dear Mr. Maxim:</i></p>

<p><i>I am very glad indeed to learn of your interest
in military preparedness. The subject is one
which is of vital importance to the American people.
We do not want to establish militarism in
this country in the sense of creating a privileged
military class, dominating the civil element, receiving
especial recognition, and exercising perhaps
an undue influence upon the administration
of national affairs, but we do want to build up in
every boy a realization of the fact that he is an
integral part of the nation, and that he has a military
as well as a civic responsibility. All this can
be done without creating a spirit of militarism or
of aggressiveness. Take Switzerland as an example.
Here we have a country where every boy
and young man who is physically sound receives,
largely as a part of his school work, military
training to the extent necessary to make him an
efficient soldier. This is a policy which ought to</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<i>be followed with our youth. It is not enough that
a man should be willing to be a soldier. He should
also be so prepared as to be an efficient one. This
can only be accomplished through training.
Switzerland and Australia have shown that this
can be done through the public-school system, and
with a resulting vast improvement in public
morals and the quality of citizenship. The criminal
rate in Switzerland is only a small fraction
of ours. Respect for the law and constituted authorities,
the flag of the country, and a high sense
of patriotism are evident on all sides, and yet
there is practically no standing army.</i></p>

<p><i>We have here a patriotic people, living not with
arms in their hands, or with a large standing
army, but trained, equipped, and ready to efficiently
and promptly defend the rights of their
country. This I believe is the ideal we should
strive for. We need a standing army big enough
for the peace work of the day, i.e., the garrisoning
of our foreign possessions, the Philippines, the
Hawaiian Islands, Panama, the little garrisons in
Porto Rico and Alaska, and a force in the continental
United States adequate for the peace
needs of the nation.</i></p>

<p><i>We must never again trust ourselves to the
emergencies of a great war without proper preparation.
If we do we shall meet with an overwhelming
disaster. Preparedness is really an insurance
for peace, and not an influence for war.</i></p>

<p><i>To send our men untrained into war to meet
equally good men, well trained and disciplined,
was once described by Light Horse Harry Lee, of
Revolutionary fame, as murder. Perhaps this is
too strong, but it certainly is a gross disregard of
human life.</i></p>

<p>The facts given in this chapter have been
gathered from many authoritative sources. It
would be very comforting if these facts were
known only to the American people, but unfortunately
they are already known to the military
authorities of all the other nations. Other nations
are all very well aware of our unpreparedness;
therefore, I am giving out no national secrets.
English, German, French, Russian, and
Japanese navy and military experts know exactly
the men and equipment we possess.</p>

<p>It is the American people only who are not
aware of the truth about our unpreparedness.
This ignorance is largely due to the beguilers who
have set the face of a great mass of our people
against armaments, and have made them turn deaf
ears to every voice that tries to rouse them to
their danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Our ship of state has been drifting down stream
like a raft. The only reason the raft has not been
wrecked lies in the fact that we have been fortunate
enough to have a pretty clear stream to ourselves
all the while, with no breakers and no
cataracts in sight. But there are breakers and
rapids and cataracts down stream, and we are at
last nearing them rapidly.</p>

<p>Even as long ago as 1880, General Emory Upton
spoke thus prophetically:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>In time of war the civilian as much as the soldier
is responsible for defeat and disaster. Battles
are not lost alone on the field; they may be
lost beneath the Dome of the Capitol, they may be
lost in the Cabinet, or they may be lost in the
private office of the Secretary of War. Wherever
they may be lost, it is the people who suffer and
the soldiers who die, with the knowledge and the
conviction that our military policy is a crime
against life, a crime against property, and a crime
against liberty. The author has availed himself
of his privilege as a citizen to expose to our people
a system which, if not abandoned, may sooner or
later prove fatal. The time when some one should
do this has arrived.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>In 1912, Admiral Kane said: "They told me in
London, 'You are living in a fool's paradise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Some day you will wake up with a fight on your
hands, and you won't be ready for it.'"</p>

<p>Not only must the United States solve the great
problem of shaping a military policy that will
enable us to establish an adequate force for national
defense in time of war, to build up and man
our Navy, construct and man coast fortifications,
and enlist, arm, and train an adequate army, but
also there must be faced the far more difficult
problem of enlisting the co-operation of the American
people in the enterprise.</p>

<p>The fathers of our country, believing that a
large standing Army would be a menace to the liberties
of the people, ordained that our Army, in
time of peace, should not exceed twenty-five thousand.
Since then, Congress has several times
raised the limit until we now may have an Army,
in time of peace, of not more than a hundred thousand
men. As a matter of fact, we have a regular
Army of 93,016, both staff and line.</p>

<p>As this Army has to be spread out over our entire
continental and outlying possessions, the sight
of an American soldier of our regular Army is
about as rare an occurrence as the sight of a sea-serpent.</p>

<p>Within the actual limits of our forty-eight
states we have but 48,428 regular troops. Of these
17,947 must be kept in our coast fortifications,
even as a pretense of garrisoning them. This
leaves only 30,481 mobile troops, including en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>gineers,
cavalry, infantry, and field artillery. We
have a militia on paper numbering 127,000, men
and officers. Only 60,000 of these, however, are in
readiness for service.</p>

<p>Therefore, we have in the United States to-day
a regular Army of 48,000, and 60,000 militia ready
for duty, or 108,000 men and officers altogether.
In time of war not a man of our militia could well
be spared for military service to repel an invader,
for in such troublesome times they would all be
needed for police duty to maintain order and obedience
throughout the country.</p>

<p>General Wood recently told us that it would
take a month to mobilize even our little Army of
thirty thousand men.</p>

<p>Out of the 127,000 officers and men of the militia
which we have on paper, only 60,000 being available,
and only 30,000 of our regulars being available,
we could place on the firing-line only 90,000
men and officers, and there would be no reserves.</p>

<p>When Napoleon, the world's greatest military
captain, went into battle, he always kept a large
and powerful force in reserve, to give confidence
to those on the firing-line, and to save the day in
case of a reverse, and possibly to turn defeat into
victory, and at the worst to cover a retreat, and
save the army from rout. This same need exists
with us for a large national reserve of well-armed
and well-trained men, ready to be called from
civil life to refill the depleted ranks of an army
at the front.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>Our regular Army is, in men and guns, but a
mere nucleus of what we ought to have, and of
what we must have to save this country from
defeat and abject humiliation should war come.</p>

<p>Not only this&mdash;the artillery we have is without
adequate field organization. It would take at least
four months to train additional personnel in order
to get our field artillery ready for duty. It would
take us four times as long, therefore, to get our
own artillery on the firing-line, ready for battle,
on either our eastern or western seaboard, as it
would for an enemy to get its artillery there.</p>

<p>It is we ourselves who are handicapped by isolation,
not the enemy&mdash;isolation not of space, but of
time.</p>

<p>If it be true that God fights on the side that is
the best equipped with artillery, God could not be
expected to fight on the side of our militia.</p>

<p>Our militia at the present time has only sixty-five
organized batteries, with four guns each. It
is absolutely imperative that we should have
seventy-nine additional batteries, with six guns
each, even moderately to complete our equipment
in field artillery. Think of it! Our militia has
less than half the number of field batteries necessary
for battle.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of mention that these batteries
are without ammunition trains, and without of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>ficers
or men for the new organization, and we
have not the necessary horses to draw the batteries
we already have.</p>

<p>Our militia is entirely without siege artillery,
while neither our militia nor our regular Army is
equipped with field mortars or howitzers of the
larger calibers now used abroad, which have been
so terribly effective in the present war.</p>

<p>Not only are foreign nations far ahead of us in
actual existing war strength in men and guns, but
also they have each an efficient system whereby
their present equipment may be rapidly expanded.
We have no such system.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Our Fatal Isolation</span></p>

<p>Never yet have we perceived the important
truth that in this age of war machinery, requiring
months and years to create, isolation by time is
an equivalent to isolation by distance. Our own
isolation in the matter of the time required for us
to raise and train armies and equip them with
shoulder-rifles, automatic guns, quick-firing cannon,
siege howitzers, ammunition supply trains,
and to build, man, and equip with guns, battleships,
battle-cruisers, torpedo-boat destroyers,
submarines, and, no less important, to equip flying
machines with trained aviators, would be a far
more serious handicap to us than our isolation by
the seas would be to our enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Scientific American</i>, February 6, 1915,
says:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>We could not supply the men for the necessary
field-artillery organization for four months, or
the ammunition trains and ammunition for a year
and a half, and not a gun is yet made or appropriated
for, for the volunteers. The militia is
short in cavalry and requires over fifty additional
troops of cavalry to provide the divisional cavalry
alone. There is an alarming absence of auxiliary
troops. Most of the militia cavalry is poorly
mounted, much of it practically without mounts,
and, with the exception of a few special organizations,
has had little or no field training. It needs
months of hard work in camp. Engineers, signal
and medical troops of the militia are as a rule
insufficient in number, deficient in organization,
equipment, and reserve supplies, and very many
of them are far below their prescribed strength
and without available personnel to fill them up.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The following is quoted from a statement made
before a Congressional committee in 1912, by General
William Crozier, Chief of Ordnance of the
United States Army, and one of the ablest officers
that the Army has ever had:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>So far as transporting troops is concerned,
the sea as a highway is not an obstacle, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
facility. It is very much easier to get any number
of troops across the Atlantic Ocean than it would
be to get the same number over anything like the
same distance on land. Marine transportation is
the very best kind you can have; the easiest, least
expensive, and most expeditious, if you are considering
large bodies of troops and large amounts
of material. The fuel charge for transportation
in good tramp steamers does not amount to one
two-hundred-and-fiftieth part of a cent per ton
per mile. The sea is a splendid means of transportation.
The distance is only ten days for a
vessel of very moderate speed, and you can carry
a thousand men on a vessel of 3,000 tons' capacity
without any trouble at all. There are any number
of vessels to be had, and there is no resistance
on this side against a well-equipped force of a
hundred thousand men.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />


<p><span class="smcap">Shortage of Officers</span></p>

<p>We have in our regular Army to-day about
4,572 officers. The number of English officers
killed, wounded, and missing during the first six
months of the European war was, in round numbers,
5,000, a little more than the total number of
our officers.</p>

<p>It has been estimated by the most able authorities,
among them the editor of the <i>Scientific American</i>,
whom I quote, that: "In case of invasion we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
would need 380,000 stationary volunteer coast-guard
troops to guard the approaches to our cities
and coast-defense works." We should also require
an additional 500,000 men at the very least.
To be rational, we should have a mobile army of
a million men. In this enormous country a standing
army of a million men would, comparatively
speaking, be small. It would still be one-fifth the
size of the German army, one-tenth the size of the
Russian army, and it would be less than the available
Japanese army. Surely this great Republic
can afford to maintain a standing army equal to
that of Japan!</p>

<p>The number of officers we have at the present
time would, of course, be practically lost in our
proposed mobile army of a million men. Radical
and immediate measures should at once be taken
to increase tenfold the officer-making capacity of
West Point. Also, any private in the ranks
should, by meritorious conduct manifesting military
promise, be open to promotion to West Point,
to complete his education there. This would be a
tremendous stimulus and encouragement to the
rank and file.</p>

<p>The burglar who has begun to plan to rob a
house and has commenced inspection of the locality
to keep tab on the movement of the police
in the vicinity, has already declared war on that
house. The bank-raider who has begun to spy on
the cashier of a bank and the nocturnal habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the people of the town, and has equipped himself
with the kit of tools and the explosives to breach
the vault where the cash lies, has already declared
war on that bank.</p>

<p>In this same sense, and to this same extent,
there is more than one nation that has already
declared war on the United States. Their spies
have been working among us for years, and they
have the kit of tools and the explosives all ready
to breach our Navy and our coast fortifications.</p>

<p>Our lack of field-guns for our artillery and our
lack of ammunition are very clearly put in the
<i>Scientific American</i> of February 13, 1915:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>We have in the hands of troops, or stored, 634
completed guns. We have under manufacture or
contract, 226. These guns will probably not be
completed for at least a year and a half. In
other words, the number of completed guns is a
little less than half the total number deemed necessary
for the field force of 500,000 men, and provides
no guns whatever for the coastguard troops
or new volunteer organizations which will be required
in addition to the 500,000 field force. Of
ammunition, we have, made and under contract,
approximately 30 per cent. for the entire project
of guns (1,292). Half of this is under manufacture
or contract, so that there is not more than 15 per
cent. actually completed. For the guns on hand
and under manufacture we have, of ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
on hand and under manufacture, about 41 per
cent.; actually on hand, approximately, 20.5 per
cent. For the guns actually made (634) we have
27 per cent. of the ammunition necessary. For
the guns now in the hands of the regular army and
militia we have about 44 per cent. of the ammunition
necessary. It should be remembered, however,
that the guns in the hands of the regular
army and militia at the present time are less than
half the guns required for these forces when properly
equipped with guns, even under our scheme
for the assignment of guns and ammunition, which
is in both instances far lower than in any of the
great armies today, and the present war has indicated,
in the case of one great power at least, that
the consumption of ammunition has exceeded
twice their maximum estimates, and that the proportion
of artillery will, in future, be increased.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At the rate of even last year's appropriations,
which were the largest made for field-artillery
guns and ammunition, it will take between eight
and nine years to complete our present modest
estimate for guns and ammunition, and the necessary
equipment in the way of ammunition trains
and other accessories.</i>"</p>

the period from April 22, 1914, to November 14,
1914:</p>

<p>Of total enlisted strength, 22.50 per cent., including
recruits and recruiting parties, belong to
the non-combatant and non-effective class, and are
not with the colors; 19.45 per cent. are in that
branch whose special function is coast-defense.</p>

<p>We have only thirty-two 6-inch howitzers and
smaller pieces, none larger.</p>

<p><i>Militia:</i></p>

<p>Total enlisted men, 119,087, of which only 52.56
per cent. have had any rifle practice, and only
33.43 per cent. have qualified as second-class
marksmen or better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Report of the Chief of Staff for the
year ending June 30, 1914, we learn that out of
our 120,000 militiamen, 23,000 failed to present
themselves for the annual inspection; 31,000 absented
themselves from the annual encampment;
and 44,000 never appeared on the rifle range from
one year's end to the other.</p>

<p>Congressman Gardner tells us, further, that
60 per cent. of our militia were unable, in 1913,
to qualify even as third-class marksmen, and that
half of that 60 per cent. (30 per cent.) did not
even try to qualify.</p>

<p>For years prior to the breaking out of the great
European conflict, Lord Roberts pleaded with
the English people, and prayed that they might
hear his appeal to prepare for war with Germany.
Like a voice crying in the wilderness, he called the
British nation to arms. His voice was not heeded,
and the nation did not arm.</p>

<p>The voice of Lord Roberts sounded harshly on
the ears of sensitive English officialdom. Lord
Haldane, to emphasize his attitude, disbanded
80,000 British troops at the very moment when
England should have enlisted and begun to train
800,000. Also, he threatened to abolish Lord Roberts'
pension if he did not keep quiet. The grand
old soldier was spared by a kind Providence to
stand on the firing-line when the great war came
which he had foreseen, and there he saw thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>sands
of his country's dead who had fallen from
failure to regard his timely warning.</p>

<p>We have a Lord Roberts, too. There is a grand
old American soldier who for years has appealed
to us to fly to arms with all speed in preparation
against war. He has even greater reason than
Lord Roberts had, because our danger is many
times greater than was England's danger. We
are practically defenseless, while England was
not.</p>

<p>I quote the following from the American Lord
Roberts, General Leonard Wood:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>... We have neither guns nor ammunition
sufficient to give any general commanding an
army in the field any assurance of success if attacked
by an army of equal size which is supplied
with its proper quota of field-artillery.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The fire of modern field-artillery is so deadly
that troops cannot advance over terrain swept by
these guns without prohibitive losses. It is therefore
necessary to neutralize the fire of hostile guns
before our troops can advance, and the only way
to neutralize the fire of this hostile field-artillery
is by field-artillery guns, for troops armed with
the small arms are as effectual against this fire
until they arrive at about 2,000 yards from it as
though they were armed with knives. This field-artillery
material and ammunition cannot be
quickly obtained. In fact, the Chief of Ordnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
estimates that almost one year would be required
to supply the field-artillery guns needed with one
field army of a little less than 70,000 men. No war
within the past 45 years has lasted for one year,
so that after war is declared it would probably be
over before we could manufacture an appreciable
number of guns; and the same applies to ammunition.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The Ordnance Department states that by running
night and day with three shifts Frankford
Arsenal could turn out about 1,600 rounds of ammunition
per day, and that if private manufacturers
were given orders to run under war conditions
they could begin deliveries of ammunition in
from three to four months, and after getting
under way could turn out about 100,000 or
200,000 rounds per month for two or three months,
and after a total time of six months the production
would perhaps equal 250,000 rounds per
month. The best estimates indicate that at the
end of the first six months not to exceed 350,000
rounds could be procured from all sources, including
the Government plant. After this six months
there would be no particular difficulty in securing
ammunition as rapidly as might be needed.</i></p>

<p>"<i>... It is my belief that ... unless private
manufacturers are now encouraged to manufacture
ammunition for our guns after war is declared,
they will not be in any condition to do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
until after the war is finished, and the supply of
ammunition during the war will be limited to what
the arsenals can turn out. At present this is
about 1,600 rounds per day, running three shifts,
and this ammunition, under ordinary battle conditions,
could be fired by eight guns in one day of
battle. If guns are not supplied on the battlefield
with the ammunition which they can be reasonably
expected to use, they are not efficient, and when
a gun has exhausted the ammunition supplied it
becomes as perfectly useless as junk; in fact, it is
worse than junk, for it must be protected by other
troops.</i></p>

<p>"<i>In the Russo-Japanese War the Russians expended
during the war, exclusive of the action
around Port Arthur, 954,000 rounds.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At Mukden in nine days they expended 250,000
rounds.</i></p>

<p>"<i>One battery of eight guns at Mukden fired
11,159 rounds, or 1,395 rounds per gun.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At Liaoyang eight Russian guns fired in three
hours 2,500 rounds, or 312 per gun.</i></p>

<p>"<i>During August 30 and 31 the First and Third
Siberians, with 16 batteries of 8 guns each, fired
108,000 rounds, or 844 rounds per gun.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At Schaho, in a four-days' fight, the artillery
of the First Infantry Division&mdash;48 guns&mdash;fired 602
rounds per gun.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At this same battle in 45 minutes, 20 minutes
of which were not occupied by firing, 42 guns fired</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<i>8,000 rounds, or 190 rounds per gun in 25 minutes
of actual firing.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The War Department believes, after extended
study, that in case of war with a first-class power
an army of 500,000 men will be needed to give this
country any chance of success against invasion,
and that this force will be needed at once. To
make it efficient it must be given its proper quota
of field-artillery. To do this this artillery must
be on hand, for it cannot be supplied after war is
started. A municipality might as well talk about
buying its fire-hose after the conflagration has
started. A fire department without its proper
equipment is worthless, irrespective of the number
of men it has; and so would be your armies,
unless you provide in peace the material which will
make them effective in war."&mdash;Statement of facts

Fortifications Bill, Dec. 9, 1913.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Is Congress To Blame?</span></p>

<p>The blame for our undefended condition is generally
attributed to Congress. It is true enough
that the main blame rests with Congress, but it
must be remembered also that Congress represents
the will of the people.</p>

<p>Every Congressman goes to Washington in the
interest of his constituents. He goes there to
dicker for them and to swap votes with other Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>gressmen
in exchanging Congressional concession
for Congressional concession. His constituents
want a post-office in their district, or a river deepened,
or widened, or want a navy yard in their
state, and he is ready to vote for similar concessions
to all other Congressmen who will vote for
the concessions his constituents require. Every
Congressman is mindful of the fact, and every
time he returns home he is reminded of the fact
that he has not been sent to Congress for his
health, but for the health of his constituents, and
if he hopes to be returned, he must see to it that
he gets what they have sent him after.</p>

<p>They have not sent him there to support an appropriation
bill for a larger army or a larger
navy. The people are imbued with the belief that
the country as a whole is big enough and prosperous
enough to be safe. They know little or
nothing, and care less, about national defenses.
No calamity has ever come upon us for lack of
defenses. Why should they worry? Also, they
have been assured from the pulpit and the Chautauqua
and by circulars sent out by the peace societies
that we not only do not need more defenses,
but, on the contrary, we do not need those we
have; and they are asked to write personal letters
to their Congressmen urging them to vote against
any appropriations to increase our national defenses.</p>

<p>I am not arguing for a large standing army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
but merely for an adequate army&mdash;an army big
enough to intercept an invading army that might
be landed on our shores in the event of our Navy
being destroyed or evaded.</p>

<p>The American people are imbued with the idea
that a large standing army is a menace to liberty.
Whatever justification there may be for this attitude,
it is certain that, if we are to yield to this
point of view, and get along with a comparatively
small effective army, it is absolutely indispensable
that we should have a navy certainly as powerful
as any in the world, with the single possible exception
of that of England. All arguments that
may be made against a large standing army become
arguments in favor of a very large navy.</p>

<p>In view of the comparative weakness of our
present Navy, we need an effective army of at
least a million men. If, however, our Navy were
to be brought to first rank and the Swiss system
of military training in public schools were to be
adopted, we could get along with a much smaller
army. By the adoption of such a system, we
should soon have a very large trained reserve
force in civil life, which could be drawn upon in
case of need. Assuming the adequacy of our Navy
and coast fortifications, General Wood believes
that, if the Swiss system of military training in
public schools were to be adopted, we could get
along very well with a standing army of from
200,000 to 225,000 men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>A navy, however large, could not, by any possible
stretch of the imagination, be termed a menace
to our liberties, and, as ex-Secretary Meyer has
said, we are rich enough to match dollars for national
defense with any other nation in the world.</p>

<p>It is common belief that military training and
service in preparation for national defense menace
democratic institutions.</p>

<p>In the days of her greatest virility and military
prowess, Rome was a republic. But we must not
conclude, because a country is governed by a congress
and a president elected by the people, that
all its institutions are more free or less autocratic
than the institutions of a limited monarchy, or
even an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>We, in the United States, often pass laws that
are so arbitrary, unprecedented, unwarranted, and
confiscatory, as to make absolutism wince. The
cities of Germany are governed so wisely and so
well that could we have that system transplanted
here, it would be almost worth our while to invite
German conquest of the country.</p>

<p>No man's patriotism rises higher than his realization
of the need that his country has for him.
None of us likes our taxes any too well. Nevertheless,
they bring home to us a better realization
of the interdependence of the government and the
individual.</p>

<p>We love those for whom we make sacrifices, and
those to whom we give favors. Benjamin Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>lin
desiring the favorable regard of a prominent
person, made it opportune for that eminent person
to do Franklin a favor.</p>

<p>Conscription, like that enforced in Germany,
makes good citizens. It implants in them a sense
of duty and obligation to the government, and
creates a greater respect for ruling power and for
law and order.</p>

<p>In this country, the ideas of the average individual
concerning his obligations to the government
and the government's obligations to him are vague
and crude to the last degree. Conscription would
largely remedy this by teaching duty to the government.</p>

<p>The government has exactly the same right to
levy on the individual for military service as it
has to tax him for anything else. Just as the government
has the right to tax the individual for
financial support of the government, so it has the
right to tax the individual for military support of
the government. Conscription makes the government
and the individual partners for the common
welfare. Few persons in this country consider
themselves partners of the government.</p>

<p>In ancient Sparta, all individuals were the property
of the government; all children were owned
by the state. Consequently, the people owned the
state, and the state owned the people. It is proper
that the state and the individual should own each
other, insomuch as their interests are mutual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
just the same as husband and wife own each
other.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best system of preparing the youth
and young men of a country for military service
is that practised in Switzerland. Switzerland is
a typical democracy, and yet no country in the
world has a more universal and efficient system
of military training for its youth and young men.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the war of 1870, Germany,
guided by the iron will of Bismarck, divulged
to Switzerland that the mailed fist had an
itching palm for Swiss territory. Immediately an
army of a hundred thousand Swiss mobilized on
the frontier. They were the best-armed, the best-trained,
and altogether the most efficient soldiers
in Europe. Every man of them could shoot to
kill. They were the flower of the mountains. Bismarck
concluded that the game was not worth the
candle. If Switzerland had not been armed to the
teeth and ready, that country to-day would be a
part of Germany.</p>

<p>The Swiss have not the remotest idea of making
an aggressive move on any neighboring country,
but they hold themselves in perfect readiness to
see to it that no other nation can find it profitable
to make an aggressive move on Switzerland.</p>

<p>Switzerland makes her military training a part
of her school system. The chubby, rosy-cheeked
little Swiss boys are taught to play soldier with
wooden imitation guns, and as they grow, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
training later becomes more comprehensive, more
exacting, more scientific, until, finally, the young
men find real guns in their hands, find themselves
commanded by, and receiving instructions from,
real officers, and they are taught to shoot. When
their school training is over, their military training
and term of military service also are over.
They are ready for civil life, but, too, they are
ready at any moment for the call of their country
from civil life to shoulder rifle and knapsack and
go to the front.</p>

<p>This is the system that we should adopt in our
country. It places no burden upon the schoolboy
or the young man; on the contrary, it is a source
of keen enjoyment, like any other manly game.
The beneficial psychological effect is simple: The
youth is taught obedience, his powers of perception
are quickened, his alertness increased, his
physique greatly strengthened, his health benefited,
and his personal habits governed by laws of
temperance and hygiene, with the result that his
efficiency for usefulness in all the business and
affairs of civil life afterward is greatly enhanced.
Thus, in Switzerland, the earning power of the
population is increased out of all proportion to the
cost for the training and maintenance of the entire
army.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Stockton, Jr., in his book, "Peace
Insurance," ably expresses the value of military
training, as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Military training has an important value entirely
apart from its actual military value. This
is conclusively proven in the numerous military
schools of the United States. The majority of
these schools disclaim any attempt to train soldiers,
but include military training merely to
make better citizens. They find that the man
trained militarily learns obedience, promptness,
cleanliness, orderliness, coolness, and secures that
priceless asset known as executive ability&mdash;the
ability to make others obey. Such schools form a
stronger character and make better men.</i></p>

<p>"<i>If this is true in a military school, it must be
equally so with similar training received elsewhere.
If thousands of parents pay from $500 to
$1,500 per year to secure this training for their
boys, surely there is some gain to the nation in
the men who receive this training in the army.
The fact is too well attested by educators throughout
the world to admit of serious questioning.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>It is possible that German militarism, by becoming
absolutism, has grown from servant to master
in Germany. However this may be, one thing is
certain, that German progress in the industrial
arts and sciences, in municipal and general government
economics, has made the German people
more efficient and potential per capita than the
people of any other country on earth. Consequently,
we must admit either that the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
are inherently superior intellectually to the people
of other nations, or that they have acquired their
present economic superiority by reason of some
procedure which they have followed, and with
which other nations have not kept pace.</p>

<p>The natural assumption is that militarism is
responsible for the German culture of efficiency.
It is not an unreasonable conclusion, in view of the
evidence, that German militarism is the greatest
school of economics that the world has ever seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE NEEDS OF OUR NAVY</h3>


<blockquote><p>"Look at the accomplished rise of Japan; think of the possible
national awakening of China; and then judge of the vast problems
of the Pacific. Only those Powers who have great navies
will be listened to with respect when the future of the Pacific
comes to be solved."</p>

<p class="right"><i>Kaiser Wilhelm II.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A famous English philosopher once took
his son to the House of Parliament, and
said to him, "Now, my boy, I want you to
witness with what ignorance and irrationality we
are governed."</p>

<p>Were that same philosopher and his son to witness
some of our American legislative proceedings,
he would find still greater ignorance and
inconsistency for the edification of his son.</p>

<p>The fathers of our country thought it necessary
to the security of our government that all naval
and military authority should be subordinate to
the civil authority. Congress is able absolutely
to dominate the Army and Navy. The Secretary
of War and the Secretary of the Navy are generally
civilian politicians. It certainly does seem
inconsistent to take a man out of civil life, who,
very likely, may be wholly ignorant of naval and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
military matters, and, through preconceived prejudice,
unalterably opposed to actual naval and
military needs, and place him in a position seriously
to interfere with the work of the officers
who have been educated at government expense
at West Point and Annapolis.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary
of the Navy ought not to be changed, regardless
of merit, or the lack of it, every time we change
a President. Those important offices should be
lifted out of politics. A man's political qualifications
for an office usually depend not a whit upon
his being suited to the office by his ability to perform
the duties of the office, but simply upon what
he has done for the party to earn the appointment.</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between political
merit and official merit. Political merit relates
entirely to party service, and may constitute demerit
when squared with the generally accepted
moral code and standard of human behavior. A
Secretary of the Army or a Secretary of the Navy
may, by previous training, ignorance, effeminacy,
or, even worse, by pacific bias, be entirely unsuited
to such a position and entirely incapable of
broadly perceiving militant duty.</p>

<p>Such changing of our war and naval secretaries
is as harmful as it would be to change the head
of a hospital every month, with the same disregard
of qualifications derived from previous edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>cation,
training, and experience. Evidently, it
would be disastrous to place in supreme command
of a hospital first an allopath, then change him
a month later for a homeopath, replace the homeopath
with an osteopath, followed by a Christian
Science healer, then a spiritualistic clairvoyant,
finally a Hindoo swami. Such a rotation of hospital
heads would hit the patients pretty hard.</p>

<p>When, however, we get a Secretary of the Navy
of the caliber of Theodore Roosevelt, or of ex-Secretary
Meyer, then the Navy profits by having
a civilian for its head, because such men as these,
who are natural judges and masters of men, are
able to make use of the greater knowledge and
experience of those under them, and they have the
additional advantage of being <i>en rapport</i> with
the civilian's point of view, while from the fact
that they are civilians, they escape the unreasoning
prejudice of the anti-militarists, who believe
that all naval and military men are actuated by
ulterior motives and self-interest when trying
to get Congressional support for the Army and
Navy.</p>

<p>A man who, through study and experience, has
become a specialist in a certain line of work, is
better qualified to do work in that line and to
know its needs than is a person who has had no
such knowledge and no such experience. In legal
matters, we go to a lawyer to get advice, and we
generally take it, and pay for it. There is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
old saw that he who acts as his own lawyer has
a fool for a client.</p>

<p>The American Congress is composed almost entirely
of civilians, who are qualified neither by
study nor experience to pass judgment on the
needs of our Army and Navy. They are as unable
correctly to diagnose the condition of our
Navy and to prescribe rational remedies as a
pastry cook would be to diagnose and operate for
appendicitis, or to prescribe for the treatment of
pneumonia.</p>

<p>It is hard to understand how there could be
any one in the country unable to perceive this
patent truth&mdash;that a person educated and trained
to a thing all his life ought to know more about
that thing than a person who has had no such
training and no such experience.</p>

<p>Yet the officers of the Army and Navy are not
permitted to give public expression to their views
on naval and military needs.</p>

<p>I quote from the New York <i>Times</i> the following
remarks on a significant incident:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Washington, Feb. 17, 1915.&mdash;Secretary Garrison
to-day instructed Brigadier-General Scott,
chief of staff of the army, to call upon Captain
William Mitchell, of the general staff, to explain
published remarks attributed to him on the unpreparedness
of the United States for war.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Captain Mitchell was quoted as having said</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<i>that 'it would take the United States about three
years to put an army of one million trained men
in the field, and in that time an enemy could take
and hold our American seaboards.'</i></p>

<p>"<i>Secretary Garrison said he considered such
utterances, if made in public at present, injudicious
and improper.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>When a hunter goes out with a gun after game,
he does not consider it good sport to shoot a four-footed
beast or flying fowl without first giving the
victim a chance for its life, and an opportunity
to give the alarm to its fellows; yet our army and
navy men, under the present gag rule, are not
given a sportsman's chance to escape being shot,
through our national unpreparedness, or even to
give a cry of warning to their fellows. Even the
murderer is given a chance to present his case
before being executed, but the American soldier
is not afforded any such opportunity.</p>

<p>Our Congress allows itself to be dominated by
impossible pacific ideas, and consequently neglects
to take the necessary sane precautions to safeguard
the country against war, or even to avert
disaster in case of war, and yet, when there arises
a <i>casus belli</i>, Congress feels no moral compunction
against declaring war and sending its ill-equipped,
thin-ranked, ill-provided Army to the front to face
inescapable death.</p>

<p>If the troops run out of ammunition on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
firing-line, they cannot retire, but must keep their
line unbroken, even though they are all killed.</p>

<p>At the battle of Spottsylvania Court House, in
the Civil War, the regiment in which my brother
Leander served was caught in exactly this position.
They had been drawn up to defend a baggage
train. They held their places, and loaded
and fired until their ammunition was exhausted;
and still they held their places under a rain of
bullets from the enemy, until reënforcements
came. Of that company, which went into the fight
a hundred strong, eighty-four were killed, among
them my brother.</p>

<p>In war, the lives of a few hundred, or even a
few thousand soldiers, count for nothing, if the
position they are holding has a greater strategic
value than their lives. When food runs short, it
sometimes becomes strategically a good bargain
to sacrifice the lives of a thousand men in a forage
raid to bring in a thousand sheep. In such a case,
a sheep is worth more than a man, because the
sheep can be eaten, and the man cannot.</p>

<p>There are some things in this world that we
are able to know are absolutely wrong. Of these,
nothing is surer than that it is wrong to forbid
our army and navy officers the public expression
of their opinions, which would give the country
the benefit of their knowledge and experience.
Not only this, but it is a great injustice to the
officers of the Army and the Navy, for, if war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
comes, it is they who will have to stand on the
firing-line&mdash;not the individuals of civilian officialdom.</p>

<p>When, in the near future, our fleet is sent to
intercept the on-coming superior fleet of an enemy,
those officers who must stand on the bridge and
at their posts on the decks&mdash;and go down with
their ships&mdash;are the very men now gagged by
civilian red tape.</p>

<p>If they could speak, and tell you and me and
all of us the truth and the naked truth, then very
likely their lives could be saved, and the sacrifice
of their ships and their crews avoided.</p>

<p>If the actual truth about our defenselessness
were generally appreciated, our whole people, as
Antony said of the stones of Rome, "would rise
and mutiny" against the legislative and bureaucratic
officialdom and the fanatical peace propaganda
that are teaching the people ignorance and
folly while muting the tongues of those who
should speak.</p>

<p>A nation is but a composite individual. Just
as the male head of the family, being the natural
protector of the family, has, in all ages, needed
strong arms for the defense of the family, so, in
all ages, have nations needed strong arms for
national defense. These are the army and the
navy. When army and navy are weak, then the
nation, regardless of other elements of prowess, is
correspondingly weak, and, more than that, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nation that is not safeguarded by a strong army
and a strong navy is a poor nation, regardless of
its resources and visible wealth. For the value
of wealth and resources is very largely dependent
upon their security&mdash;upon the power of the army
and navy to defend or guarantee the title to them.</p>

<p>That man is not a rich man, the title to whose
property is questionable and likely at any time
successfully to be disputed. The value of wealth
depends entirely upon the ability of its possessor
to control and utilize it, which includes the ability
to defend his title to it.</p>

<p>The same thing holds true with a nation. The
value of its wealth depends entirely upon its
ability to control and utilize it, subject absolutely
to ability to defend it.</p>

<p>You and I, reader, may count ourselves worth
a certain sum. But if our property is not so safeguarded
as to ensure our continued possession and
benefit of it, and to ensure to our children and
our children's children the possession and benefit
of it, then we are by no means so rich as we
should be were our title guaranteed by adequate
national defenses.</p>

<p>We are at once the richest country in the world,
and, in proportion to our wealth, the poorest; for,
in proportion to our wealth, we are the most defenseless.
By consequence, we are without guaranty
of title to our property, and we may at any
time be robbed of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>An adequate army and an adequate navy are
the only possible means by which American titles
to property can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Just as it is worth all it costs, and more, for
owners of real estate to have the title to their
property guaranteed by a title-guarantee company,
and just as the property is by such guaranty
enhanced in value more than the cost of the guaranty,
so the guaranty of title to American property
dependent upon an adequate army and navy
is worth far more than the entire cost of them, by
virtue of enhanced values.</p>

<p>When a nation, like the United States, has become
a World Power, with outlying possessions
in distant seas and within the spheres of influence
of other powerful nations, it assumes obligations
just in proportion to the hazards involved in the
maintenance of title. Also, when a nation, like
the United States, has a world-compassing commerce,
its obligations are just as large as its commerce,
and its need of a navy adequate to defend
its commerce is, for that purpose alone, exactly
as great as its need of the commerce. But, in addition
to this great need, there is the still greater
need of a navy of such magnitude and potentiality
as effectually to safeguard the country against
invasion.</p>

<p>Although we should have an army of sufficient
size and possessed of so efficient equipment as ultimately
to repel invasion, still the cost in life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
treasure for repulsion and expulsion would exceed
many times the cost of the warships and naval
equipment necessary to prevent invasion.</p>

<p>The American people are not all agreed that we
should have a navy. There is a very large percentage
of the population who believe that we
ought not to have any at all. But there is one
ground, I think, for common agreement: Admiral
Austin M. Knight, President of the Naval War
College, one of the best-informed and ablest officers
in the Navy, as well as one of the most
scholarly men in the country, says:</p>

<p>"<i>If we are to have a navy it should be as efficient
as it can possibly be made. And everybody
who knows anything about the Navy knows that
this is not its present condition.</i>"</p>

<p>I shall quote further from a recent speech of
Admiral Knight:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>There is much about the Navy which is splendidly
efficient. But as a whole it is far less efficient
than it can and ought to be. Our ships are
fine. Our officers are capable, industrious, and
ambitious. Our enlisted men are the equals of
those in other navies. But efficient ships and officers
and men do not alone make an efficient
navy. They must be welded into an efficient whole
by a unity of organization and administration
and purpose which coördinates their capabilities
and directs their efforts towards a common end,
wisely selected and very clearly seen. Here is
the first point at which we are lacking. We are
lacking also in that harmonious composition of
the fleet which is needed to give to every element
of it the support that it needs from other elements,
to make up a symmetrical and well-balanced
whole. And we are lacking to a marked
degree in absolutely essential facilities for the
care and preservation of our ships, especially in
the matter of dry-docks.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/illus193.png" width="444" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>Finally, we are lacking in efficient organization
of the personnel. Here, so far as officers are
concerned, the conditions are altogether deplorable.
In a service like the Navy, where spirit is
everything, where enthusiasm must be the driving
power back of every activity, I ask you to picture
the effect of a condition where a young officer,
graduating from the Naval Academy full of
spirit and enthusiasm, finds himself confronted
with a prospect of promotion to the grade of Lieutenant
at the age of 52 years.</i></p>

<p>"<i>If you ask me who is responsible for these
conditions, I can only reply that the responsibility
comes home to nearly all of us. Some of it, I am
sure, rests with me;&mdash;much of it, I believe, with
you. Certainly it cannot be attributed in excessive
measure to any one administration of the
Navy Department, for it has existed for half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
century at least. So let us not cloud the issue by
assuming that it is a new condition, and that all
administrations up to some recent date have been
models of wisdom and efficiency, or that Naval
Officers themselves have always been ready with
good advice. Speaking as the representative of
Naval Officers as a body, I frankly admit that we
have not always seen clearly what was needed,
and have not always worked together even for
ends which we did see clearly. As for the Secretaries
of the Navy, it is not surprising that many
of them have failed to realize that their first duty
was to strive, in season and out of season, to promote
the War efficiency of the Navy as a whole.
Many of them have not remained in office long
enough to learn this. Some, perhaps, have realized
it more or less clearly but have not found at
hand an organization through which they could
produce results. A few have made material contributions
toward improved conditions....</i></p>

<p>"<i>A large part of the responsibility, especially
that connected with the small size and the unbalanced
composition of the Fleet and the lack of
dry-docks, rests with Congress, which has always
approached naval legislation from the wrong side
so far as efficiency is concerned;&mdash;asking, not
what do we need for efficiency? but what can we
afford to spend for efficiency? Behind the responsibility
of Congress lies the responsibility of
the Country,&mdash;and you, gentlemen, represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Country&mdash;because it has not insisted upon having
what was needed, without reference to cost. It
may be that this attitude of both Congress and
the Country is necessary and even inevitable. But
I am one of those who believe that this great
Country of ours can afford to have anything in
the way of national defense which it needs, and I
assume that all present here to-night agree that
we need a navy, and if a navy, then an efficient
one, and that whatever efficiency costs is the
measure of what we can afford to spend.</i></p>

<p>"<i>What constitutes an adequate Navy for the
United States? The answer will depend, of
course, upon the purpose for which we assume
that the Navy is to be used. We are all agreed, I
presume, that it is not to be used for aggression.
Is it, then, to be used solely for defense? If we
answer 'yes,' we ought to do so with a full recognition
of what we are to defend and also of the
elementary maxim that the best defense is a
vigorous offense. In other words, no matter how
resolute we may be to use our Navy only for repelling
aggression, it does not follow that we
should plan for meeting the aggressor only at our
gates. Even if we had no interests outside our
borders and no responsibilities for the defense of
our outlying possessions and dependencies, we
should still, as reasonable beings not wholly ignorant
of history, prepare to project our battle
line toward the enemy's coasts and to assume a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
course which would throw upon him the burden
of replying to our initiative. In this sense, then,
we need a navy for offense; that is to say, for offensive
action with a defensive purpose. In shaping
our plans along these lines, we should not
overlook the fact that the policy which dictates
the measure of our defense must take full note of
the larger national policy which it is to enforce;&mdash;in
relation, for example, to the Monroe Doctrine,
the Panama Canal, the Philippines, and other
matters which are at once of national and of international
significance.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>If the United States does not need a navy, then
we should dispose of the fighting ships we have
and disband the personnel. If, on the other hand,
we do need a navy, there is one consideration,
and one consideration alone, that can rightfully
determine the size and power of that navy&mdash;namely,
its adequacy to serve the purpose for
which it is intended.</p>

<p>A fighting ship is built, equipped with armament,
manned, and coaled for one sole purpose&mdash;that
of adequacy in a fight. Its success or failure&mdash;in
short, its usefulness or uselessness&mdash;depends
entirely upon its fighting adequacy against a possible
opponent. An ocean-liner is built, manned,
and coaled to fight tempestuous seas, and safely
make the voyage; but unless the ship is built sufficiently
staunch, has sufficiently powerful engines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is well manned, and has coal enough for the trip,
it is in no sense a success, or useful; on the contrary,
it is an utter failure and worse than useless.</p>

<p>The same thing holds true of a navy: Unless it
can defeat the fleet of an enemy, and return from
the voyage, it is a failure, and worse than useless.</p>

<p>A naval disaster in our present condition would
be likely to be an irreparable calamity, while a
naval victory might likely win the war. It is for
this big difference that we need a navy. Consequently,
the entire use of a navy may be summed
up in the one word, <i>superiority</i> over a possible
enemy.</p>

<p>When two men run for a municipal office all the
votes cast for the loser are of no value to the
loser, and all campaign funds spent in getting
them have been wasted; the only votes that are
of value to the winner are those that constitute
his majority. Similarly, in a naval battle, it is
the majority of votes cast by the winning guns
that secures the victory, for all of the other votes
cast by the guns are balanced by an equal number
of votes cast by the guns of the enemy.</p>

<p>The total value of a navy may be summed up
in the value of one battleship, which gives a conquering
preponderance in gun-fire.</p>

<p>Admiral Knight recently said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>The War College considers that every effort
of the Fleet, and every effort of the Department
in connection with the Fleet, should have for its
sole aim the war efficiency of the Fleet. Every
effort which does not directly contribute to this
end is in itself a wasteful expenditure of energy,
and so far as it is a diversion from this end, is
distinctly harmful.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Among all those who have occupied positions of
trust and power, and whose business it has been
to recognize and provide for our naval and military
needs, it is remarkable how few have had
the necessary breadth of view to grasp the
strategic situation, and perceive its requirements
without making silly and costly mistakes, like that
of the construction of our first three battleships,
the <i>Oregon</i>, the <i>Massachusetts</i>, and the <i>Indiana</i>,
merely for coast-defense purposes. None of these
ships was qualified for service in distant waters.
Then, when the war with Spain came, we held our
breath while the <i>Oregon</i> rounded the Horn. Think
of the United States of America being in such
straits for fighting ships as actually to hang national
hope on the old <i>Oregon</i>. A single shell
from one of the huge guns of an up-to-date British
super-dreadnought has a striking force equal to
the energy required to lift the old battleship
<i>Oregon</i> bodily to a height of more than six feet.</p>

<p>There is no middle course for the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
We must play the game as a World Power, and as
other nations are playing the game. To get fair
play we must provide ourselves with the weapons
with which they are providing themselves. If we
do not, we shall be brushed aside with a ruthless
hand, and shall find our commerce circumscribed
on every side by inimical spheres of influence&mdash;dead
lines over which we shall not dare to pass.</p>

<p>It is necessary for us not only to fortify the
Panama Canal, but also to maintain a navy of
sufficient prowess to enable us to reach that Canal
at all times, and under all conditions, for it is indispensable
that we maintain communication with
our defenses there.</p>

<p>Should we become involved in war with England
or Germany, the navy of either being more
powerful than ours, we should be immediately isolated
from the Panama Canal zone. Similarly,
Japan could successfully blockade the Pacific approaches
to the Canal.</p>

<p>We have, at enormous expense, cut a great
waterway through the Isthmus, and established a
short route between the Atlantic and the Pacific.
The Canal is our property. Other nations of the
world may use it. We generously built it for the
world's welfare. It will, however, be valuable in
time of war for the passage of our warships; in
fact, it will be a vital necessity to us. But our
ability to use it for that purpose will be entirely
dependent upon the ability of our Navy to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the sea clear of an enemy's ships at either end.</p>

<p>The war with Spain was very useful, because
it brought the truth home to us that the command
of the American seas is absolutely vital to us.
Immediately following the Spanish War, we rapidly
built up our Navy, until it became second only
to that of England. But we have, of late years,
been slipping back, until now our Navy occupies
third place, with a likelihood of soon dropping
down to fifth place.</p>

<p>In 1905, England evolved the great modern
dreadnought, which was as much of a revolution
over existing types of fighting ships as was Ericsson's
<i>Monitor</i> over the fighting ships of its time.
The dreadnought relegated all existing battleships
to the second line.</p>

<p>The dreadnought was so much superior in size,
in speed, in gun-fire, and in all defensive and offensive
qualities, that it took its place at once as
the indispensable first-line battleship. England,
Germany, France, Japan, each recognizing the tremendous
superiority of the dreadnought, enlarged
their naval appropriations, and built dreadnoughts.</p>

<p>The American Congress, however, failed to recognize
the serious character of the crisis. It
failed to appreciate the fact that the dreadnought
meant a revolution in battleship construction. Instead
of naval appropriations being increased according
to our needs, they were decreased. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a result, there are now two nations at least that
could whip us off the seas, while the navies both
of France and Japan are likely very soon to rank
above us.</p>

<p>All our illusions about our splendid isolation
would vanish with the destruction of our fleet. A
European Power could, in less than two weeks,
land upon our shores an army of from 100,000 to
200,000 men. Here, the question naturally arises:
How would they be able to get past our coast
fortifications? We have spent about $160,000,000
on our coast fortifications, but they were never
intended for the protection of our entire coast
line. They were intended only to defend our important
cities and harbors and naval bases. They
actually protect but a very small fraction of our
many thousand miles of shore.</p>

<p>As the <i>Scientific American</i> has justly stated, our
coast fortifications should not be so named; instead,
they should be designated as city-and-harbor
fortifications.</p>

<p>It would be quite impracticable adequately to
defend our long stretch of seaboard by means of
coast fortifications. The only coast fortifications
that can effectually serve us are battleships. It
is absolutely indispensable to our integrity as a
nation that we have a fleet sufficiently powerful to
defend our whole coast against invasion.</p>

<p>These questions present themselves: How are
we to ascertain what our naval needs are? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
shall we prepare to meet them? Of whom shall
we seek guidance?</p>

<p>Several years ago the Navy Department organized
the General Board of the Navy, headed by
Admiral Dewey. This Board studied our needs
with great diligence and care, and Congress was
advised accordingly.</p>

<p>All the leading navies of the world have a technical
body corresponding to our General Board,
but in other countries that body speaks with authority,
while our General Board may only advise.
Congress pays but little attention to these
advisers. It is a principle of our government that
the voice of the greatest number shall rule, and
the people of this country have come to believe
that the majority is more likely to be right than
the minority. Many falsely believe that in the
matter of wisdom there is safety in mere numbers;
that the opinion of a hundred men is of more value
than the opinion of a single man.</p>

<p>Multiplying the number of individuals possessing
a limited amount of knowledge and an unlimited
amount of ignorance does not raise the high-water
mark of their united wisdom. Wisdom
means intellectual height. Some men are seven
feet high intellectually, while others are not more
than a foot high.</p>

<p>The average of conscientiousness is much higher
than the average of intelligence. A man's sincerity
cannot be used as a yard-stick for measuring
his intellectual height. Sincerity and conscientiousness
are sister entities, and are largely
a measure of intellectual bias, whose other name
is prejudice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus205.png" width="600" height="396" alt="Strategic Spheres of Vital Importance in the Pacific" title="" />
<span class="caption">Strategic Spheres of Vital Importance in the Pacific</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>We may compare the intellectual height of men
with one another in a manner similar to comparing
their physical height, only there is a much
greater disparity in the intellectual than there is
in the physical. If we take a man six feet high,
and stand another man beside him of equal or
less height, the height of the two men is no greater
than that of the first man. If we add a hundred
men of average height, we shall find that the average
height of the whole line is considerably less
than that of the six-footer with whom we started.</p>

<p>The same thing holds true with the intellectual
height of men. We may put a man in each chair
in the House of Representatives and in the
Senate, and the total height of the voting wisdom
of the majority will be only the average height of
that majority, and it will be less than that of one
man who might be selected for his wisdom from
their number.</p>

<p>Any one member of the General Board of the
United States Navy is likely to know much more
about the needs of the Navy and what Congress
should do for the Navy than is known by all members
of the House and Senate put together.</p>

<p>Representative Gardner very possibly knows
more about our naval and military needs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
what Congress ought to do for the Army and Navy
than is known by all the other members in Congress.
In fact, he may likely know more about
the subject and be able to advise the country with
greater wisdom upon our needs for national defense
than a line of average Congressmen standing
shoulder to shoulder in a string that would
girdle the earth.</p>

<p>Napoleon said, "He goes fast who goes alone."
Always, the great national issues that make history
have been decided in each case by one man,
and all great national crises have depended upon
the decisive action of one man. In recognition of
this principle, Rome, in times of great peril, chose
a dictator.</p>

<p>The Medo-Persian empire was the architecture
of one man, Cyrus the Great. The Persian
empire was conquered and destroyed by the
genius of one man, Alexander the Great. Rome
was brought to her knees by one man, Hannibal.
He ultimately failed, and Carthage was destroyed,
because of one man, an eloquent
enemy of Hannibal, Hanno, at home in Carthage,
who was a peace-advocate. Rome was
saved from destruction at the hands of the
Teutons and Cimbri solely by the military genius
of Marius. Cæsar walked alone through Gaul,
solitary in his height above his whole army; by
comparison, all men of his age were pygmies.
Charles Martel alone saved Europe from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Moors. Peter the Great, the amazing architect
of Russia, was impatient of advice and brooked
no interference with his purpose. Cromwell alone
was the governing brain of England. Frederick
the Great was great because he played the game
of war lone-handed. Napoleon Bonaparte was so
intellectually tall that he towered over Europe like
a colossus, and he played kings like pawns in the
game of war. Bismarck played a lone hand in
the creation of the German empire. During the
entire Civil War, Abraham Lincoln parried with
wit the advice of friends. To his enemies, he
masked with mirth an inscrutable purpose, while
he sat solemn and solitary at the helm.</p>

<p>So, always and always, it has been. Great national
games have been games of solitaire.</p>

<p>We need a national leader who shall have such
size and quality of brain, and be possessed of such
soul, courage, and wisdom as shall qualify him to
use the power of his high office to the full to help
save this country from the dire calamity that is
impending.</p>

<p>Although the General Board knows a thousand
times more about our needs and what we ought
to do to provide for them than is known to the
entire American Congress, still Congress, dominated
by the pride of ignorance, believes that it
knows best, oblivious to the fact that the voiced
ignorance of a thousand men may have less truth
in it than the voiced wisdom of a single man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Members of Congress assume the responsibility
of deciding what the strength of the Navy shall
be, and what shall be its composition. Congress,
not the General Board, decides how many battleships,
cruisers, destroyers, and submarines we
shall have; how many officers and men they shall
carry. The result is disastrous, for our Navy is
inefficient and ill-balanced. It is dangerously weak
where it should be strongest.</p>

<p>During the administration of Lord Haldane
(then Mr. Haldane) the British Admiralty Board
resigned because four battleships had been cut
from the estimates for new construction, which
were set at the minimum of national requirements;
and it is due to forcing the matter by this action
that the British have the four big battle-cruisers,
of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> type, carrying 15-inch
guns, which throw a shell weighing 1,925 pounds,
and which out-range all other guns on ships.</p>

<p>Robert Blatchford, whom Mr. Winston Churchill
dubbed a "ridiculous Jingo," said, in a remarkable
series of articles written before the outbreak
of the present war for <i>The Daily Mail</i> in the hope
of arousing the British public to their danger:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>But the British people do not believe it. The
British people take little interest in foreign affairs,
and less in military matters. The British
people do not want to bother, they do not want to
pay, they do not want to fight, and they regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as cranks or nuisances all who try to warn them
of their danger.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The danger is very great, and is very near.
It is greater and nearer than it was when I began
to give warning of it, more than five years
ago....</i></p>

<p>"<i>The people are conceited, self-indulgent, decadent,
and greedy. They want to keep the Empire
without sacrifice or service. They will shout
for the Empire, but they will not pay for the Empire
or fight for it. Germany knows this. The
world knows it. The Cabinet Ministers know it.
But no Minister dares to say it. We are in sore
need of a</i> man....</p>

<p>"<i>While the articles have been appearing in <font>The
Daily Mail</font> I have received letters of strong approval
from Lord Roberts and Lord Charles
Beresford, and from many officers of the Army
and the Navy.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Are all these men ignorant and stupid, and
are political wisdom and military knowledge confined
in these islands to the lawyer who runs our
Army, the lawyer who runs our Navy, and the
simpering nonentities who edit the Nonconformist
organs?</i></p>

<p>"<i>The Liberal Government made a fatal blunder
when they hesitated to lay down the four extra
dreadnoughts. They were trying to economize.
They were hoping for a cheaper way out of the
difficulty. They were waiting for something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
turn up. The Germans knew this, and made a
tremendous effort to get ahead of us. It is not
safe to trust the tradition of Micawber against
the tradition of blood and iron.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Had the British Government, instead of trying
to save a few millions, asked the nation
boldly for the full amount required, and set about
the necessary work in earnest, the Pan-Germans
might have had an unpleasant time with the German
taxpayer.</i></p>

<p>"<i>It is time our Government and people recognized
the facts. Germany has challenged us. If
we show weakness we are lost. We cannot bluff
our enemy. We cannot evade him. We cannot
buy safety for an old song. We can only hold our
own against so powerful and resolute an antagonist
by showing an equal power and resolution.</i></p>

<p>"<i>In the crisis to which I have just referred we
took the weak course when we ought to have taken
the strong one. Economy at such a time is the
most profligate extravagance.</i></p>

<p>"<i>When the Government held the four dreadnoughts
back, they should have been pushing a
dozen dreadnoughts forward; when they tried to
save a few millions they should have laid out fifty
millions. Instead of reducing the artillery and
pottering about with a handful of Territorials
they should have demanded an Army.</i></p>

<p>Now, reader, carefully weigh this wonderfully
prophetic language, spoken by an Englishman to
the English people, before the great war came,
which is now wringing millions upon millions of
pounds sterling from the English purse, and
wringing blood from the veins of thousands upon
thousands of young men gathered from the length
and breadth of the whole empire, and wringing
tears from millions of mourning eyes; let us take
this powerful appeal of Blatchford to the English
people and conceive it to be my own appeal
now, to you and the whole American people. We
are in the same danger that England was, and
unless we prepare as England did not prepare we
shall be wrung even more than England is wrung.</p>

<p>Our naval officers, who, more than all others,
know what we should have in kinds of ships, in
numbers of ships, and in personnel, are ignored.
It is a case of the blind leading those who see
clearly.</p>

<p>After the most careful and thorough, investiga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>tion
and weighing of our Navy's actual needs, the
General Board of the Navy figures closely, as near
to the danger point as they dare, in order that
their recommendations may stand a better chance
of approval by Congress. But Congress assumes
that, being naval men, they have an ax to grind
and are naturally strongly biased in the direction
of extravagance, and the Board's wise recommendations
are accordingly discounted.</p>

<p>We have only 33 battleships less than twenty
years old, eleven of which belong to the second
line, with four building and authorized, which will
make 37 in all. The General Board thinks that
we should have 48 battleships less than twenty
years old.</p>

<p>We have but 68 destroyers, while the General
Board thinks that we should have 192 destroyers.</p>

<p>The General Board thinks that we could squeeze
along with a minimum of 71,000 men to man our
present fleet, without taking into account additional
trained men needed for signal and tactical
work on board auxiliary vessels, and without any
provision for warships now building. As a bare
fact, we have only 52,300 men. Thus we are short
18,000 of the men needed to man the fleet we have.
In addition to this, there is a shortage in sight of
4,000 men required to man the fighting ships that
will go into commission in 1915 and 1916.</p>

<p>Our naval experts tell Congress that we shall
need 50,000 more men for the Navy as soon as they
can be enlisted and drilled; but the ears of Congress
are deaf to the appeal. Yet a whisper for
a new post-office can be heard by a Congressman
from his home district a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>We have only 7,700 men in our naval militia.
We have no naval reserve.</p>

<p>Congressman Gardner informs us, as a result
of his investigations, that it would take five years
to get a reserve of 25,000 sailors.</p>

<p>Our best-informed naval officers recommend for
coast defense the immediate construction of a
hundred submarines of the latest and most successful
type. As a matter of fact, this number is
far too few. We now have but 58 submarines,
including those built, building, and authorized to
be built. Many of those we have are obsolete and
absolutely worthless.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from a report by
the General Board of the Navy in 1913, which is
very enlightening:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>The absence of any definite naval policy on
our part, except in the General Board, and the
failure of the people, Congress, and the executive
government to recognize the necessity for such a
policy, has already placed us in a position of inferiority
which may lead to war; and this inferiority
is progressive and will continue to increase
until the necessity for a definite policy is recognized
and that policy put into operation.</i>"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>A fleet, to be effective, must be so constituted,
organized, and trained as to benefit in the highest
degree from team work. It must be able, like a
baseball team, to act with the precision of a
machine.</p>

<p>In addition to battleships, a fleet must have an
appropriate number of battle-cruisers, smaller
cruisers, transports, scouts, destroyers, submarines,
colliers, tank-ships, supply ships, repair
ships, mine-laying ships, tenders, and gunboats.
Hospital ships should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Admiral Fiske says:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>We have only one mine-layer. We need five
additional mine-layers. On board that one mine-layer
are only 336 mines. Germany had 20,000
mines when the war started</i>."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>A fleet without fuel-ships is like a fleet without
stokers. A fleet without scouts is blind. It cannot
see the enemy's movements, while its own movements
lie under the eyes of the enemy. The
videttes are called the eyes of an army. Similarly,
the scouts of a fleet are the eyes of the
fleet. A fleet without these eyes, when hunted by
a fleet that has them, is in the same position as a
hunted ostrich with its head hidden in the sand.
Of these fast scouts, with minimum speed of 25-30
knots an hour, we have only three; Germany has
14, and Great Britain has 31.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Two fleets maneuvering for attack&mdash;one provided
with scouts and the other without them&mdash;are
relatively in the position of two men, armed
with revolvers, fighting in a room, one blindfolded
and the other with eyes uncovered.</p>

<p>As Admiral Knight has observed, battleships
alone do not make a fleet, much less a navy. Our
fleet is greatly weakened by our lack of destroyers.
A fleet should always be accompanied by a large
number of these vessels to support the scouts, and
also to do scout duty themselves. They stiffen
the screen about the battleships, and, when an
opening is present, they are ready to dash against
the enemy.</p>

<p>In the Civil War and in the Spanish War we
were able largely to employ improvised merchant
vessels for fuel-ships and scouts; for the sole reason
that our enemies were even more miserably
unprepared than ourselves. Had we, at the time
of the Spanish War, been called upon to fight a
really first-class Power, we should have been
swept off the seas.</p>

<p>Fuel-ships and scouts cannot be improvised
under modern conditions. They must be ready before
war comes. It is just as fallacious to imagine
that we can strengthen our Navy with improvised
ships and personnel after war is declared, and get
it in trim to meet a modern fleet in the pink of
condition of preparedness, as it would be for an
invalid cripple to imagine that he could train and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
get into condition for a victorious fight with a
John L. Sullivan after entering the ring.</p>

<p>Of all arts and sciences, that of war is the most
highly specialized. The greatest intelligence and
skill are called into play to produce special tools,
and to render their use highly efficient.</p>

<p>The armies and navies of the European nations
and of Japan are trained, just as college athletes
are trained for boat-racing, baseball, football, and
competitive contests of the gymnasium. The personnel
is kept in the pink of condition for prompt
and decisive individual effort and also for supreme
collective effort in team work.</p>

<p>A pugilist finds it necessary to train with the
most complete thoroughness to get himself into
prime condition for a fight, while his opponent is
training in the same manner. When they meet,
it is not the strength, skill, and endurance of the
normal man that counts in the fight, but it is the
supernormal manhood that has been added to the
normal man. An ordinary untrained citizen, although
he may possess undeveloped resources
equal to those of the trained pugilist, would have
no chance whatever in a fight with him.</p>

<p>Similarly, such an army and a navy as we
should be able to improvise in time of war would
have no more chance of success against an army
and fleet of a European nation or of Japan than
the average citizen would have with a skilled,
toughened, and hardened pugilist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one source of our naval weakness that
of itself alone may bring disaster. It is incomprehensible
that such a condition should be allowed
to exist. When a fleet goes into distant
waters, it should have a nearby base. We have
neither the coaling stations nor the dry-docks and
harbors of refuge that are absolutely indispensable
to the fleet of a country with world pretensions.</p>

<p>It is absolutely vital that we should be able to
defend the Panama Canal, but we have no dry-docks
or efficient repair-shops there, and we have
none within a thousand miles of there.</p>

<p>A couple of million dollars well spent to remedy
this defect might, Admiral Knight declares, very
conceivably double the efficiency of the fleet in a
critical emergency by making it possible for every
ship to go out in perfect condition.</p>

<p>We have capable naval bureaus of Ordnance,
Construction, and Repair, and for the direction
of personnel; but these bureaus are not responsible
for the readiness of the fleet for war. Admiral
Knight suggests a remedy. He says:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>This is the last and great defect in the efficiency
of the Navy. How shall it be remedied?
The answer is, I think, by the creation in the Navy
Department of a 'Division of Strategy and Operations'
preferably not co-equal with the present
Bureaus but superior to them and standing between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
them and the Secretary. This arrangement
would be a recognition of the fact that all the
activities of the present Bureaus should lead up
to the Secretary through a channel which coördinates
them all and directs them toward war
efficiency.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The title proposed for the new office:</i> <span class="smcap">Division
of Strategy and Operations</span>, <i>covers very
completely the ground that I have in mind. As
standing for Strategy this Division would plan
what to do; and as standing for Operations, it
would direct the execution of its plans. It would
correspond more or less closely with the General
Staff of the Army and the First Sea Lord of the
British Admiralty,whose duties are thus defined</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"1. <i>Preparation for war: All large questions
of naval policy and maritime warfare&mdash;to
advise.</i> 2. <i>Fighting and seagoing efficiency
of the fleet, its organization and mobilization,
including complements of ships as
affecting total numbers, system of gunnery
and torpedo exercises of the fleet, and tactical
employment of air-craft, and all military
questions connected with the foregoing; distribution
and movements of all ships in commission
and in reserve.</i> 3. <i>Superintendence

<p><span class="smcap">How Money Appropriated for the Navy is
Wasted</span></p>

<p>George von Lengerke Meyer, former Secretary
of the Navy, has many times in recent years called
attention to the fact that a large proportion of the
money appropriated for the upbuilding and up-keep
of our Navy has been misapplied to the building
and up-keep of useless navy yards.</p>

<p>During the first fifteen years of the present century,
we spent $1,656,000,000 on our Navy, while
during the same period Germany spent $1,137,000,000.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that during this period
Germany spent 31 per cent. less money on her
navy than we did on ours, she has a more powerful
navy than we have. This difference represents
a sum of more than half a billion of dollars. With
that amount of money we could have built two
super-dreadnoughts a year, for the past fifteen
years, costing $15,000,000 each, with $60,000,000
to spare for battle-cruisers, destroyers, and
submarines. In short, had we spent our naval
appropriations as economically as have the Germans
during the past fifteen years, we might
have had thirty more battleships than we now
have, all super-dreadnoughts of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>
type, the latest and most powerful pattern.
This number of up-to-date super-dreadnoughts
would have far more than doubled the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
strength of our Navy. We should have out-classed
England in battleship strength.</p>

<p>The following facts are so pregnant and so important
and so ably expressed that I can do no
better than to give them in Mr. Meyer's own
words:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Until within a few years no naval appropriation
could pass the Senate which did not meet the
sanction of both a Northern and Southern Senator,
each of whom was a member of the Committee
on Naval Affairs. It is interesting, in consequence,
to analyze some of the appropriations
between 1895 and 1910.</i></p>

<p>"<i>In 1899 a site was purchased in Frenchman's
Bay, Maine, at a cost of $24,650&mdash;far above the
assessed valuation&mdash;and later an additional
amount of $600,000 was expended to obtain there
an absolutely unnecessary coaling-station, which
has since been dismantled, as it was practically
unused.</i></p>

<p>"<i>At the Portsmouth Navy Yard, so called, in
Kittery, Maine, a dock was built at an expense of
$1,122,800, and later it was found necessary to
blast away rock in the channel in order to reach
the dock, at an additional expense of $745,300.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Between 1895 and 1910 improvements, machinery,
repairs, and maintenance in the yard
amounted to $10,857,693, although there was a
large navy-yard within seventy miles.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>On the other hand, at Port Royal, South Carolina,
a dock was built at the insistence of the
Southern Senator, at a cost of $450,000, which
proved useless, and, although the original cost of
the site was but $5,000, it was not abandoned as
a naval base until $2,275,000 had been expended.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Not the least daunted by this extravagant
waste, the same Senator determined to have a
share of the naval melon for his State, so, with
the assistance of the Northern Senator, he obtained
the establishment of another naval station
at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1901. There
was no strategic value thus accomplished, nor
was it necessary, with the Norfolk Navy-Yard located
at Hampton Roads. The $5,000,000 which
has been squandered at Charleston includes a dry-dock
built for battleships, costing $1,250,000, but
which experience shows can only be used by torpedo-boat
destroyers and gunboats. The $5,000,000
could have been employed to great advantage
at the Norfolk Navy-Yard, where the battleship
fleet generally assembles. A portion even could
have been used wisely at Key West, Florida, a
supplementary base of real strategic value for
torpedoes and submarines&mdash;a protection to the
Gulf of Mexico and the mouth of the Mississippi
River, and on account of its geographical situation,
Key West would serve as a base of supplies
to the fleet in the Caribbean Sea.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The purpose of the navy-yards is to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
fleet in efficient condition. Their location should
be determined by strategic conditions, their number
by the actual needs of the fleet. The maintenance
of navy-yards which do not contribute to
battle efficiency is a great source of waste.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The United States has over twice as many
first-class navy-yards as Great Britain, with a
navy more than double the size of ours, and more
than three times as many as Germany, whose navy
is larger than that of the United States.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The total cost of navy-yards up to June 30th,
1910, with land, public works, improvements, machinery,
and maintenance, including repairs,
amounts to $320,600,000.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Overburdened with a superfluous number of
navy-yards distributed along the Atlantic coast
from Maine to Louisiana, in 1910 I recommended
that Congress give up and dispose of naval stations
at New Orleans, Pensacola, San Juan, Port
Royal, New London, Sackett's Harbor(New
York), Culebra,and Cavité, none of which was a
first-class station. The average yearly cost of
maintaining these stations between 1905 and 1910
was $1,672,675, and very little useful work had
been performed at any of them. Later, I practically
closed them, but could not abolish or dispose
of them, no action having been taken by Congress.
Pensacola and New Orleans have since
been reopened by my successor.</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>

<p>"<i>The interests of the country and the interests
of the Navy would be best served by one first-class
naval base with sufficient anchorage for the entire
fleet, north of the Delaware, equipped for docking,
repairing, etc., and another station of equal
capacity at Norfolk, in Chesapeake Bay, with
Guantanamo, Cuba, to serve as the winter-station
rendezvous.</i></p>

<p>"<i>On the Pacific coast we are fortunate in having
only two naval stations, one at Bremerton, on
Puget Sound, established in 1891, with ample
depth of water, costing to date about $9,000,000;
and the other at Mare Island, established in 1850,
some thirty miles from the harbor of San Francisco,
with inadequate depth and width of water
along its water-front. The total costs, with maintenance
and repairs, have amounted to $35,000,000,
and, on account of insufficient depth of water,
none of the battleships built in the last eight years
could have been berthed there....</i></p>

<p>"<i>Building battleships without an adequate
force of men is equal to wasting money; only ten
ships of the first line and eleven of the second,
according to the Navy Department, can be placed
in full commission for service, due to a shortage
of men and officers.</i></p>

<p>"<i>To provide a proper complement for all vessels
of the Navy which could still be made useful
would require an additional force of 18,556 men
and 933 line officers, according to the testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of Admiral Badger before the Naval Committee,
December 8, 1914.</i></p>

<p>"<i>That we have not been getting proper return
for money expended in the Navy is not known to
the majority of our people, nor is it realized to
what extent political influences have misdirected
the appropriations during the past twenty-five
years. The remedy will only come from absolute
publicity.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Let a special committee be appointed to investigate
the conditions in the Navy.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Let a special committee of military experts
from the Army and Navy be appointed to recommend
what naval stations shall be abolished and
sold and if any shall be established to take their
places.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Let Congress inaugurate a national council of
defense made up of members of the Cabinet,
Senate, and House, with the chiefs of staff from
the Army and Navy, that more efficient co-operation
may be obtained between the executive and
legislative branches of the Government in respect
to military requirements.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Let Congress establish a general staff in the
Navy.</i>"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>LANGUAGE OF THE BIG GUNS</h3>


<p>In the present war, the big guns, both on land
and sea, have told their own story, and they
have commanded conviction of their usefulness
in proportion to the loudness of their voice.</p>

<p>Following the introduction of armor-plate by
Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>, armor-plate
was answered by increasing the size of guns
and projectiles. Brown prismatic powder was developed
to slow the burning and lessen the initial
pressure, thereby securing a better maintenance
of pressure behind the projectile in its passage
along the bore of the gun.</p>

<p>Guns weighing more than a hundred tons were
built in England for the use of brown prismatic
powder, but it was found that after firing a few
rounds, the guns drooped at the muzzle under the
shock of discharge, and lost their accuracy.</p>

<p>The invention and development of smokeless
gunpowder, mainly during the ten years between
1887 and 1897, resulted in radical improvements in
guns of all calibers.</p>

<p>Only about 44 per cent. of the products of combustion
of the old black powder and the brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
prismatic powder were gaseous. The balance,
about 56 per cent., were solid matter, and produced
smoke. It will be seen, at a glance, that
smokeless powder, whose products of combustion
are entirely gaseous, possesses enormous ballistic
advantages, quite independent of its smokelessness.
Less than half the products of combustion
of the old smoke-producing powders being gaseous,
much energy was absorbed from the gases,
to heat and vaporize the solid products constituting
the smoke. Additional heat was consumed by
the work of expelling the smoke from the gun.</p>

<p>The products of combustion of smokeless
powder are not only practically all gaseous, but
also they are much hotter than the products of
combustion of the old, smoky, black powder.
Owing to this fact, smokeless powder may be considered
about four times as powerful as the old
black powder.</p>

<p>When a projectile is thrown from a gun, although
it is not heated appreciably, yet heat-energy
represented by its velocity is absorbed from the
expanding gases of the powder charge. When a
12-inch projectile weighing a thousand pounds is
thrown from one of our long naval guns, it has
a striking energy, fifty feet from the muzzle, of
about 50,000 foot-tons&mdash;that is to say, it strikes
with a force equal to that of 50,000 tons falling
from a height of one foot, or one ton falling from
a height of 50,000 feet. As the 12-inch naval gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
weighs about 50 tons, the energy absorbed from
the gases in the shape of velocity of the projectile
is sufficient to lift a thousand 12-inch guns to a
height of one foot.</p>

<p>As a projectile weighs half a ton, the force of the
blow is about the same as though the projectile
were to be dropped from a height of twenty miles,
with no deduction for the resistance of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>When the projectile is stopped, a quantity of heat
is re-developed exactly equal to that absorbed from
the powder gases in giving the projectile its high
velocity; and the quantity of heat absorbed from
the powder gases in throwing a thousand-pound
projectile from our big naval guns is sufficient to
melt 750 pounds of cast iron, which is enough to
heat the projectile white hot.</p>

<p>Obviously, when the projectile strikes armor-plate,
either the plate or the projectile must yield,
for the reason that the projectile brings to bear
upon a 12-inch plate an energy sufficient to fuse a
hole right through it, and this is substantially
what it does. The hard and toughened steel of the
plate is heated and softened by the force of impact,
and, although the projectile may be cold after
it has passed through, it actually does fuse a
hole through the plate, the metal flowing like wax
from its path.</p>

<p>The introduction of smokeless cannon-powder
was followed by a recession from guns of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
weight and caliber, to guns of smaller weight and
smaller caliber, the aim being to make up for the
greater smashing power of huge projectiles,
thrown at a lower velocity, with projectiles of
smaller size, thrown at much greater velocity and
having a greater power of penetration of armor-plate,
which was constantly being made thicker
and tougher and harder in order to resist the impact
of armor-piercing projectiles.</p>

<p>As armor-plate continued to increase in thickness
and in powers of resistance, guns of bigger
and bigger caliber had to be made, capable of withstanding
the enormous pressure necessary to
throw projectiles of sufficient size and at sufficiently
high velocity to penetrate any armor-plate
that could be opposed to them.</p>

<p>With every improvement in armor-plate, the
gun and the projectile have been improved and
enlarged, until now no armor-plate carried by any
ship can withstand the naval guns of largest caliber.
In its race with armor-plate, the gun has
thus far been the winner.</p>

<p>The victory of the <i>Monitor</i> over the <i>Merrimac</i>
at Hampton Roads, half a century ago, was far
less decisive than was the victory of armor-plate
over the gun of that time.</p>

<p>The whole world well remembers the story of
how the <i>Monitor</i> arrived in the nick of time, and
saved the Federal fleet from destruction. But the
salvation of the Northern fleet was of little ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>vantage,
for the advent of the <i>Monitor</i> rendered
obsolete and useless every warship of every fleet
in the world.</p>

<p>Great Britain found herself without a navy.
There was universal consternation. It was a
world-wonder that no government had before resorted
to so simple an expedient, and one whose
utility was so very evident.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the guns of that
period were muzzle-loading smooth-bores, and
that the round, solid projectiles thrown by them
were intended merely to knock holes in the sides
of wooden warships and to pound down the walls
of brick or stone forts. Bombshells were then
thin, hollow spheres of cast iron, charged with
black gunpowder, and they were not intended for
penetration, their destructiveness depending upon
the fragments hurled by their explosion, or upon
their ignition of inflammable material.</p>

<p>It is a curious phase of human progress that
what is old and tried is venerated and conserved
with solicitous regard out of all proportion to
merit. Innovations must not only have evident
merit, but their merit must also be so indubitably
proven by application and use as to replace the
old and revered, in spite of the opposition of overzealous
conservatism. The substitution of the sail
for the galley-slave was a very slow process, until
it received especial stimulus in the fierce forays
of the marauding Northmen and the raids of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Mediterranean corsairs. Similarly, did the sail
slowly give way to steam.</p>

<p>A modern wooden steam-launch or a forty-foot
motor-boat, with cedar sides, driven by gasolene-engines
and armed with a single three-and-a-half-inch
gun, would be able today to attack and
destroy the famous <i>Monitor</i> of Ericsson, in spite
of its armor-plate, for the reason that the launch
or motor-boat would have vastly greater speed,
and also for the reason that its gun would have
vastly greater range, and would be able to penetrate
the soft iron armor of the <i>Monitor</i> with projectiles
charged with a high explosive to explode
inside. The motor-boat, lying outside the range of
the huge 11-inch guns of the <i>Monitor</i>, could hold
a position of perfect safety during the conflict,
and, by consequence, would need no armored protection.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the sufficiency of armor-plate
must, other things being equal, inevitably depend
upon insufficiency in range and penetrating power
of the gun to which it is opposed. An unarmored
vessel, with guns capable of penetrating the
armor-plate of an opponent having shorter-range
guns, needs only to have superior speed in order
to choose a position out of range of the armor-clad's
guns, and, atmospheric conditions being
favorable, to destroy it without itself being exposed
to any danger whatsoever.</p>

<p>But there are other conditions which prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
gun, however long its range and however great
its power of penetration, from being a complete
defense in the absence of armored protection.
These conditions are&mdash;the limit of vision due to
the rotundity of the earth, even in clear weather,
the limitation of vision, at much nearer distances,
in thick or hazy weather, and, of course, the
greatly increased difficulty of hitting at extreme
ranges. Also, it is necessary to be able to observe,
from the fighting-tops, where trial shots strike, in
order to get the correct range, and lay the guns
exactly upon the target.</p>

<p>In the recent North Sea fight, firing began at
more than 17,000 yards, or about ten miles; 12-inch
and 13-inch shells from the British ships struck
the <i>Bluecher</i> before more than the upper works of
the <i>Bluecher</i> could be seen from the decks of the
British ships. Only by the fire-control officers, a
hundred feet above the decks, could her whole hull
be seen. When the first huge shells came plunging
down out of the sky upon the <i>Bluecher</i>, her gunners
could not see the ships from which they came.</p>

<p>It is true that with much more powerful guns
than those of her enemy, an unarmored vessel
would be able to shoot right through any armored
protection opposed to them. But there is the
danger that an armored ship of an enemy may
emerge from the fog or haze, or from out of the
darkness at night, and then neither speed nor
weight of gun-fire might save the unarmored ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
The unarmored vessel would not be able with her
small guns, if she carried them, materially to injure
her armored enemy, whereas the enemy, with
its secondary batteries, firing with enormous rapidity
and faster than the speed of the heavier
guns, would be able to riddle her in a few moments.
Consequently, it is considered wise to employ
sufficient armor to afford protection against
the rapid-fire guns of smaller caliber. Such
armor also at longer ranges affords considerable
protection against the big guns, for it must be
expected that not all projectiles will strike the
plate at right angles. They strike at all angles,
and sometimes at very sharp angles, and glance
off, in which case armor of moderate thickness
may save a ship by diverting the shots, while, if
she were wholly unarmored, she might be destroyed.</p>

<p>We may then conclude that an ideal fighting
ship would be one having very great speed, carrying
very large and powerful guns, and protected
by armor-plate of but moderate thickness. Actually,
such a ship is the modern battle-cruiser. We
have as yet not one of these ships in our Navy,
while the Japanese have two of the most powerful
in the world, and more building; England has
eight, and more building; Germany has four, and
more building.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<p>The first improvements following the advent of
armor-plate were made, as might be supposed, in
the gun and in the projectile. The old smooth-bore,
with spherical projectile, was replaced by
the breech-loading rifle and the conical projectile
having a copper driving ring and gas-check, by
which a projectile possessing enormously greater
mass for its caliber could be hurled at much higher
velocity and kept point on.</p>

<p>Extraordinary improvements have been continuously
made in armor-plate, to harden and
toughen it and to give it greater powers of resistance,
while battleships have been made larger
and larger to support heavier and heavier armor-plate.
Nevertheless, the first improvement in guns
and projectiles that followed the advent of the
armor-clad, gave the gun the lead, and the gun has
kept the lead ever since.</p>

<p>Today, the long-range, high-power naval gun,
charged with smokeless powder, and throwing a
projectile made of tempered steel inconceivably
tough and hard, and charged with high explosive,
is the most powerful dynamic instrument ever produced
by man. A 12-inch naval gun throws a projectile
weighing half a ton, at a velocity nearly
three times the speed of sound. A charge of three
hundred and seventy-five pounds of smokeless
powder, strong as dynamite, is employed for the
projectile's propulsion.</p>

<p>It may be safely assumed that at fighting ranges
the residual velocity of a 12-inch, armor-piercing,
half-ton projectile, thrown from one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
powerful 12-inch naval guns, develops heat enough
upon impact to fuse its way through 12-inch plate.</p>

<p>When a solid body comes into collision with
another solid body, the energy of motion is instantly
converted into heat, except such portion
of it as may be consumed in fragmentation, and
retained in the motion of the flying pieces. If two
armor-plates, twelve inches in thickness, could be
brought together face to face, each with a velocity
equal to that of a modern 12-inch projectile, the
energy of the impact would be sufficient to melt
both plates.</p>

<p>New suns are created by the occasional collision
of great celestial bodies in their flight
through space. The heat generated by such collisions
is, however, vastly greater than that developed
by the collision of a projectile against
armor-plate, for the reason that the velocity of
celestial bodies is so much greater, being commonly
from thirty-five to fifty miles per second,
and sometimes as high as two hundred miles per
second, instead of but three-quarters of a mile per
second. The heat developed by the collision of
worlds is sufficient not only to fuse them, but also
to gasefy them, and reduce them to their ultimate
elements. All the suns that emblazon the evening
sky have been created in this manner, and the
heat generated by their natal impact is sufficient
to maintain their radiant energy for hundreds of
millions of years. Planets are born, some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to become inhabited worlds, finally to grow old and
die, with the extinguishment of all life upon them,
while their parent sun is still blazing hot.</p>

<p>The earth is being constantly bombarded with
meteorites, usually of very small size. But the
earth is armor-plated with its envelope of air.
The impact of meteorites upon this envelope, at
the enormous speed at which they are traveling
through space, is fatal to them, and they are
dashed to pieces and consumed upon it, as though
it were a solid shield of hardest tempered steel.
It is seldom, indeed, that a meteorite has sufficient
size and mass to penetrate through the atmosphere
to the earth's surface. Were it not for
the protection offered by the earth's envelope of
air, every living thing upon its surface would be
very soon destroyed by the meteoric bombardment
from the heavens. A minute particle of meteoric
dust, traveling at celestial velocity, would be more
deadly than a bullet from a shoulder-rifle.</p>

<p>When a projectile is fired from a gun, it encounters
the same atmospheric resistance, in proportion
to its velocity and mass, as is encountered
by a meteorite, the resistance increasing in a ratio
something like the square of the velocity. When a
battleship fires a 12-inch shot at another war-vessel
ten miles away, the velocity is greatly reduced
during flight, for an enormous amount of
energy is consumed in punching a 12-inch hole ten
miles long through the atmosphere. Gravitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
also, is drawing the projectile toward the earth
with a constant pull of half a ton, to counteract
which the trajectory must be made an upward
curve. This makes the path longer, and consumes
additional energy in raising the projectile to the
top of the trajectory.</p>

<p>If a projectile could be thrown from a gun at
a velocity equal to that of a meteor, it would blaze
like the sun during flight, for the metal upon its
surface would be fused and gasefied by the resistance
and friction of the air. It would not make
any difference whether it were made of the toughest,
hardest tempered steel, or whether it were
made of soft iron. The velocity would be so great
that it would pass through the heaviest armor-plate
without appreciable reduction of speed. If
the projectile were of lead, it would require armor-plate
of a greater thickness to stop it than if it
were of steel, for the reason that its mass or
weight for its bulk would be greater.</p>

<p>Distance and the intervening air are our most
efficient protection. No armored defense now employed
is wholly effectual, except the range be
long. By consequence, then, future naval battles
will be decided more and more by speed and size
of guns, rather than by armored protection.</p>

<p>Were two modern dreadnoughts to battle at as
close range as did the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>,
immediate destruction would be mutual. They
would cripple each other more in four minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
than did the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i> in the four
long hours during which they pounded each other.</p>

<p>The <i>Alabama</i> and <i>Kearsarge</i> fought for more
than an hour, within bowshot of each other, before
the <i>Alabama</i> was destroyed. Were two of the biggest
and most heavily armored battleships in the
world to fight today at as close range, one or the
other of them would be destroyed in a very few
minutes.</p>

<p>The projectiles fired from the monster naval
guns now weigh many times as much as those
thrown from the guns of either the <i>Monitor</i> or the
<i>Merrimac</i>, and these huge projectiles have also a
multiplied velocity. The total thickness of the
armor of the <i>Monitor's</i> turret was ten inches. An
iron wall of the character used in Ericsson's turret,
five feet in thickness, would not afford adequate
protection against our modern, monster
guns.</p>

<p>Of course, the character of armor-plate has been
vastly improved since that time. Instead of being
merely soft iron, as was that of the <i>Monitor</i>,
armor-plate is now made of the hardest and toughest
tempered steel that science can produce. So,
also, is the projectile. The projectile has far more
than held its own. It is necessary, therefore, that
the most heavily armored ships, as well as those
unarmored, must fight today at long range, depending
mainly upon skilled marksmanship and
power and range of guns, rather than upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
armored protection. A battle at close range between
two huge modern dreadnoughts would be as
deadly to both combatants as a duel between two
men standing close together, face to face, holding
pistols at each other's breast.</p>

<p>When a chemical engineer makes an invention,
and needs money for its exploitation, he first interests
capitalists by letting them see the invention
practised on a laboratory scale, embodying
essentially the same conditions as would be involved
in the larger commercial application.
Similarly, we may get a very just and dependable
idea of the relative efficiency of guns and
armor-plate on a naval-battle scale, by taking into
consideration what would be the result of a lesser
conflict, embodying essentially the same conditions.</p>

<p>Suppose two men were to fight a duel, one wearing
armor capable of protecting him as efficiently
against rifle balls as the heaviest armor carried
by any warship today is capable of protecting it
against modern cannon-fire; the other wearing no
armor, and being thereby enabled to run much
faster than his armor-clad opponent. Obviously,
if the unarmored man had a gun of longer range
than that carried by the protected man, he would
be able to keep out of range of his enemy's gun,
while still keeping him well within range. Thus he
would be able to continue firing at him until he
killed him, without in return being hit at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>At the battle of Santiago, the American fleet
made only about two per cent. of hits with its 12-inch
guns. Since that time very great improvements
have been made in fire-control, and the
accuracy of gun-fire. Today, a battle-cruiser, going
at the rate of thirty knots, will hit an object
on the sky-line a tenth the size of a battleship
with the accuracy that Buffalo Bill from horse-back
would hit a man's hat at a distance of twenty
paces.</p>

<p>In the naval battle between von Spee and Cradock,
off the coast of Chili, they opened fire on
each other with deadly effect at 12,000 yards. In
the running fight off the Falkland Islands, most of
the execution was done at a range of 15,000 yards.</p>

<p>In the North Sea fight, according to the report
of Admiral Beatty, the British shots began to take
effect on the enemy at ten miles, and the whole
battle was fought at a range of over seven miles.
The German guns, being mounted so that they
could be elevated much more than the British,
were able to shoot not only as far, but even farther.
The British guns, however, were much more
effective, because of the greater weight of metal
thrown.</p>

<p>When projectiles are increased in size the atmospheric
resistance at equal velocity increases as
the square of the diameter, while the mass increases
as the cube of the diameter. Consequently,
large projectiles lose less velocity during flight, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
proportion to their weight, due to the resistance
of the air, than do smaller projectiles.</p>

<p>Only within the last few years has rapid-fire
with very large guns become possible. Now, however,
loading machinery has been so perfected
that the limit is no longer that of hand-power.
Wherever in nature forces are opposed, there is a
tendency toward an equilibrium. There is now a
tendency toward the establishment of an equilibrium
between the power of offense and the power
of defense&mdash;between gun-fire and armor-plate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the mean force of gun-fire remains
still far superior to that of armored resistance.
The mean armored resistance is now about on a
par with that of the moderate caliber guns, as, for
example, 6-and 8-inch guns. If there were no
larger guns than those of 6-and 8-inch caliber,
guns and armor-plate would be about neck and
neck in the race. Consequently, we must look to
the winning of naval victories by the employment
of guns of more than 8-inch caliber.</p>

<p>Speed is of such supreme importance in naval
engagements that its value should be especially
emphasized. Superior speed enables the fleet possessing
it to choose its own position, thus determining
the range and the direction from which
the attack shall be made. If the fleet happens to
have guns of larger caliber and longer range than
the enemy, it may be important, also, to choose
its weather by keeping out of action until it can
fight at the maximum range of its own guns. The
slow fleet must always fight at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Let us picture two opposing fleets drawn up for
battle. The fleet with fastest ships and guns of
longest range, lining up at the maximum effective
distance for its fire, steams at first in a line parallel
with the enemy and in the same direction that
the enemy is steaming. The faster fleet is soon
able to run its van ships forward of the van ships
of the enemy, turning in front of them, thereby
bringing the front ship of the enemy's line under
the combined fire of its own two foremost ships,
while the rearmost ship in its line of battle gets
out of range of the rearmost ship of the enemy,
placing the latter entirely out of action. This
movement is continued until the enemy's line is
encircled, crumpled up, and destroyed. Therefore,
we see that superior speed enables the fleet
possessing it to put a portion of an enemy's fleet
entirely out of action, while at the same time placing
the remainder of the enemy's ships under the
combined fire of a superior number.</p>

<p>In June, 1897, I delivered a lecture before the
Royal United Service Institution of Great Britain,
in which I illustrated and recommended the employment
of a gun of very large caliber for use
on fighting ships and in coast fortifications.</p>

<p>The United States government had, several
years previously, adopted the multi-perforated
smokeless cannon-powder invented by me. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
form of grain rendered it possible to use a pure
nitro-cellulose smokeless powder in large guns,
because it greatly reduced the initial area of combustion
in proportion to the mass, while as the
combustion progressed this condition was reversed
and a very large area was presented to the
flame of combustion in proportion to the mass.
Consequently, the initial pressure in the gun was
much reduced, while greater pressure was maintained
behind the projectile in its flight through
the gun than could be obtained by any other form
of grain. This made possible the attainment of
a very high velocity, with a comparatively low
initial pressure and, consequently, with comparatively
small strain upon the gun. For this
reason, and because of the low heat in the combustion
of pure nitro-cellulose powder, the erosive
action upon the gun was reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>I invented another and a special form of multi-perforated
grain by means of which a yet lower
initial pressure for a given density of loading
was secured, the rate of combustion being still
more highly accelerated.</p>

<p>Believing that the advantages of projectiles of
great size, carrying a very large bursting charge,
could be better illustrated by a gun of extraordinary
caliber, I designed a cannon having a caliber
of twenty-four inches, but having a weight of only
43 tons, the weight and length of the gun
being the same as the British 12-inch 43-ton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
gun. This gun was designed to throw a semi-armor-piercing
projectile weighing 1,700 pounds,
and carrying an explosive charge of 1,000 pounds,
the total weight of the projectile being 2,700
pounds. While the projectile was not designed
to pierce heavy armor, it was capable of penetrating
the decks and sides of light-armored cruisers
and deep into earth or concrete for the destruction
of forts. It was a veritable aërial torpedo.
By means of the special form of multi-perforated
smokeless powder designed for this gun, the
huge projectile could be thrown to a distance of
nine miles with the gun at maximum elevation,
and still with a comparatively low chamber pressure.</p>

<p>The projectile was provided with a safety delay-action
detonating fuse, designed to explode it
after having penetrated the object struck, thereby
securing the maximum destructive effects.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Germans have made a
huge howitzer weighing 45 tons, having a caliber
of 23-1/2 inches, which also is capable of throwing a
projectile weighing more than a ton to a distance
of nine miles.</p>

<p>The drawings used in my lecture were published
in the <i>Journal of the Royal United Service Institution</i>,
April, 1898, and re-published in many scientific
and engineering magazines, and in newspapers
both here and abroad. The descriptions
of this gun and projectile were illustrated, as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the manner of its employment for the destruction
of the kinds of forts destroyed by the Germans at
Liège and Namur.</p>

<p>The use of high explosives in big armor-piercing
projectiles is now universal, but on the publication
of my lecture in 1897 I was subjected to much
criticism, especially in some of the London newspapers,
whose editors took issue with me as to the
practicability of throwing large bursting charges
of high explosives from high-power guns. Prior
to that time the only success achieved in throwing
large charges of high explosives was by use of
the Zalinski pneumatic dynamite gun, a battery
of which had been made and mounted at great expense
at Sandy Hook. These air-guns imparted
a maximum velocity of only about 600 feet per
second to the projectile. The maximum charge
was 600 pounds of nitro-gelatin. The projectile
had no penetrating power whatsoever, and was designed
to go off on impact.</p>

<p>My proposition to throw large charges of a
high explosive from a big gun, at high velocity,
using a propelling charge of gunpowder, appeared
to many to be a very hare-brained intention
indeed, to say nothing of shooting it through
armor and exploding it behind the plate.</p>

<p>On my return to America in 1898, I laid the
matter before General A. R. Buffington, Chief of
the Bureau of Ordnance, United States Army, and
Admiral Charles O'Neil, Chief of the Bureau of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Ordnance, United States Navy. General Buffington
sent me to Sandy Hook, where my new explosive,
Maximite, was subjected to a very thorough
trial. The first 12-inch projectile charged with
it was buried in sand in an armor-cased cellar,
and exploded. More than seven thousand fragments
of the projectile were recovered, being
sifted out of the sand. Twelve-inch projectiles
charged with Maximite were repeatedly fired
through 12-inch armor-plate without exploding.
Later, similar projectiles, armed with a fuse, were
fired through the same plate and were exploded
behind the plate. Although Maximite was fifty
per cent. stronger than ordinary dynamite, yet
it was so insensitive to shock as to be incapable
of being exploded without the use of a very strong
detonator. Maximite was the first high explosive
successfully to be fired through heavy armor-plate,
and exploded behind the plate, with a
delay-action fuse. The fuse employed at that time
was the invention of an army officer. Later, my
fuse was subjected to a very long series of
tests, and it was finally adopted in 1907 as
the service detonating fuse by the United States
Navy.</p>

<p>If Uncle Sam would listen with an understanding
mind to the language of the big guns now
speaking on land and sea, he would immediately
build a large number of huge howitzers. He would
build a large number of good roads, capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
standing the tread of these howitzers. He would
build as well a goodly number of battle-cruisers,
as big and as fast as any afloat in foreign seas,
and armed with guns ranging as far as the guns of
any foreign power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AËRIAL WARFARE</h3>


<p>In the present European War is being tested
the enginery of destruction and slaughter
that has been building and accumulating for
half a century. It is the most stupendous experiment
that the human race has ever tried. The
magnitude of it confounds the senses; the horror
obsesses the mind and stumps realization.</p>

<p>The influence of improvements in all kinds of
weapons and machinery of war is further and
further to complicate strategics. The more that
invention, science, and discovery are employed
in the development and perfection of implements
of war, the more the use of those implements
requires high inventive genius and high scientific
skill.</p>

<p>Before the outbreak of the war there were
many military engines awaiting a practical trial
in actual service, among them the dirigible balloon.
During a period of forty years the nations
of the world have been obliged to do a good deal
of guessing, in spite of calculations based on
previous experience in wars whose mechanism
was very simple and crude as compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
present engines of war. But the improvements
in weapons employed on terra firma did not constitute
so far a step away from experience as
engines of aërial warfare. Those engines of war
which have been mainly the subjects of guess-work
are the aëroplane and that dreadnought of
the air, the Zeppelin, especially the latter. The
advent of the aëroplane introduced an entirely
new set of problems.</p>

<p>Before the advent of the aëroplane, the navigation
of the air was confined to the balloon.
Contrary to expectation, the aëroplane, instead
of putting the balloon out of the race, served only
to stimulate higher development of the balloon,
with the result that the dirigible balloon and
the aëroplane have been developed side by
side.</p>

<p>From the outset, it was recognized that the
chief desideratum in the development of the
aëroplane consisted in greater stability, and especially
in automatic equilibration.</p>

<p>The first aëroplanes were very imperfect. At
the time of the early exhibitions which I witnessed,
it was necessary to plan them to take
place in the calm of the evening, just before sundown.
The aëroplane could not go up in a wind.
No aëronaut would have undertaken to go up
except when there was no wind. Even a moderate
breeze made them quite unmanageable.
Now, however, the aëroplane can rise in a gale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of wind, and fly right into the teeth of a hurricane.</p>

<p>The old-style balloon could only go with the
wind. It could make no headway against it, but
had to float like a feather on the lightest breeze.
The modern dirigible, however, which has reached
its highest degree of perfection in the Zeppelin,
can travel through still air at a speed of sixty
miles an hour, the speed of a gale of wind, and
can brave a fifty-mile gale at a speed of ten miles
an hour. This is altogether remarkable when we
take into account the fact that the Zeppelin, with
all its load, must be lighter than air, and therefore,
for its size, lighter than the fluffiest eiderdown.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Limitations of the Aërial Bomb</span></p>

<p>Aviation makes a strong appeal to the imagination,
and this fact, together with errors and
misconceptions in the popular mind concerning
the use and power of high explosives, has led to
many strange predictions and weird conclusions
about the destruction which dirigibles and aëroplanes
would be capable of doing by dropping
bombs from the sky.</p>

<p>Since the advent of aviation, many inventors
have directed their energies to aërial bombs and
bomb-dropping appliances. There have been,
from time to time, fearful forecasts of the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>struction
of warships, coast fortifications, and
large cities; for it was claimed that air-craft
would be able to drop explosive bombs capable
of wrecking the heaviest battleship and of blowing
up coast fortifications and utterly laying
waste cities and towns. It was predicted that
the aëroplane would be able, with its bombs, to
scatter armies like chaff before the whirlwind.</p>

<p>The hopes of those who have believed in such
dire destructiveness of bomb-dropping from air-craft
have been dashed to the ground, with the
bombs they have dropped. Of course, aviators
may drop any form of infernal machine which, on
exploding, will mangle by-standers with fragments
of scrap iron, but the effect must necessarily
be very local.</p>

<p>The most effective use aviators can make of
bombs and infernal machines is to destroy one
another in the sky and to attack magazines and
storehouses, wireless stations, hangars, and balloon-sheds
within the enemy's lines, and beyond
the reach of other means of attack. Also, in connection
with the attack of advancing troops, aërial
bombs dropped from aëroplanes may be used with
effect, especially in disentrenching an enemy. At
sea, too, with the latest types of aëroplane, bombs
of sufficient size and weight and power of penetration
may be used destructively against unarmored
or light-armored war-vessels. A more
efficient means, however, than has yet been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
adopted is needed to secure the required accuracy.
Naturally, such bombs are admirably adapted to
the destruction of dirigible balloons. The swift-winged
aviator is able to man&oelig;uvre at will around
and above a huge dirigible and to attack it from
any quarter.</p>

<p>There is probably no one subject about which
there is more popular error than concerning the
use and destructive effects of high explosives.</p>

<p>An anarchist once attempted to blow up London
Bridge with two small sticks of dynamite,
and succeeded merely in getting himself into
trouble. At another time, a dynamiter entered
the Houses of Parliament and exploded ten
pounds of dynamite in one of the large corridors,
with the result that it only made a hole in the
floor and smashed a few windows.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, airships are capable of
working comparatively small damage by dropping
bombs, unless the bombs can be made to hit
and penetrate the object struck before exploding,
for the reason that, unless confined, explosives
have but little effect.</p>

<p>When a mass of high explosive is detonated
upon a firm, resisting body, like the earth, or the
deck of a battleship, or armor-plate, the effect is
to rebound from the resisting body with small
result. For example, when a mass of high explosive
is set off on the earth's surface, the ball
of incandescent gases bounds upward, spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
out in the form of an inverted cone. While it
will blow a hole of considerable size into the
ground, still the effect in a horizontal plane is
practically nil. The windows of buildings standing
in the vicinity of an explosion of this character
are not blown inward, but are blown outward
in the direction of the explosion by atmospheric
reaction.</p>

<p>At Sandy Hook, several years ago, an experiment
was tried with two hundred pounds of guncotton
exploded against a twelve-inch plate, immediately
back of which were placed a cage containing
a rooster and a hen, and another cage
containing a dog. The guncotton was hung
against the plate and detonated. The effect upon
the plate was nil. On examination, it was found
that the dog and the two fowl had been made
rather hard of hearing. That was the only
noticeable effect upon the animals.</p>

<p>We all remember the test of the big, eighteen-inch
Gathmann gun at Sandy Hook about twelve
years ago, which threw a bomb containing six
hundred pounds of compressed guncotton that
was exploded against the face of a twelve-inch
Kruppized plate. The first shot produced no visible
effect except a yellow smudge on the face of
the plate. It took three shots even to crack the
plate and to shift it in its setting.</p>

<p>In competition with the Gathmann gun, a
twelve-inch army rifle was fired against another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
plate of the same size and thickness and mounted
in the same manner. The projectile contained
only twenty-three pounds of Maximite. Yet, as
the projectile penetrated the plate before the Maximite
was exploded, a hole was blown through it
a yard wide, and it was broken into several pieces.</p>

<p>These tests proved the effectiveness of even a
small quantity of high explosive when properly
confined, as by explosion after penetration, and
the utter ineffectiveness of a large mass of high
explosive when not confined or when exploded on
the outside of a body.</p>

<p>Bombs carried by an airship and dropped upon
the deck of a battleship may damage the superstructure
a little, but they can have no material
effect upon the ship itself, unless they are made
heavy enough and strong enough, with the proper
armor-piercing shape, and are dropped from a
sufficient height to pierce the deck. Not unless
the bomb can be made to penetrate an object before
exploding can it effect much destruction.</p>

<p>At Santiago, the <i>Vesuvius</i>, with its pneumatic
guns, threw several six-hundred-pound bombs,
and exploded them on the Spanish fortifications,
but the effect was wholly insignificant.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when the subway was being
built, a dynamite magazine accidentally exploded
in front of the Murray Hill Hotel. The magazine
probably contained at least a ton of dynamite. A
lot of windows were broken in the vicinity, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
persons were injured, and a multitude badly
scared, but the damage done even to the Murray
Hill Hotel was comparatively small.</p>

<p>It has been predicted that Germany would send
across the Channel a large fleet of airships and
blow up British towns with the bombs that her
great gas-bags might drop out of the heavens.</p>

<p>Now, at last, the much-vaunted and long-anticipated
Zeppelin invasion has come, and what is the
result? Four peaceful citizens killed, and about
ten thousand dollars' worth of property damage.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the Germans should send
a fleet of a hundred airships to drop bombs upon
the city of London, returning to Germany each
day for a new supply; and let us suppose that
each airship should carry explosives enough to
destroy two houses every day, which would be far
more than they could actually average. Yet, if
this aërial fleet should be able to destroy two
hundred houses a day, or say, roughly, sixty thousand
houses a year, it would succeed in destroying
just about the annual growth of London, for
that city has, during the past ten years, built sixty
thousand new houses every year.</p>

<p>The dirigible balloon has one signal advantage
over the aëroplane in the matter of bomb-dropping.
It can both carry bigger bombs and remain
stationary and hover while it drops them. With
the aëroplane, however, there is necessarily great
difficulty in hitting underlying objects, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of the high speed at which it must travel to sustain
flight. In order to float, an aëroplane must
travel about thirty miles an hour. Even at this
speed, it is moving forward at the rate of forty-four
feet a second, and as a bomb travels at the
same speed as the aëroplane, except for the retardation
of the air, it moves forward forty-four
feet the first second, while dropping sixteen feet.
The next second the bomb falls sixty-four feet
and moves forward forty-four feet, and so on.</p>

<p>Sixty miles an hour is a moderate speed for an
aëroplane, however, and at that speed the bomb
travels forward eighty-eight feet per second when
it is dropped, so that, during the first second,
while it descends but sixteen feet, it moves forward
eighty-eight feet. It falls sixty-four feet
the next second, and moves forward eighty-eight
feet, and so on, descending in a parabolic curve,
so that, by the time it strikes the earth, it may be
several hundred feet from the place at which it
is aimed.</p>

<p>Although the dirigible balloon, a Zeppelin, for
example, may hover in a stationary position at
will when dropping bombs, still it constitutes such
an enormous target that it must fly very high in
order to keep out of range of gun-fire. Guns are
now made which can reach air-craft at the height
of two miles. At that height, or at half that
height, there can be but little accuracy in bomb-dropping,
even from the stationary Zeppelin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The efficiency of a fighting machine is exactly
proportionate to the amount of life and property
that it can destroy in a given time with the minimum
exposure of property and life in order to
do the work. If a fleet of a dozen Zeppelins should
be able to attack and destroy an entire British
fortified town like Dover, it would be a good investment.
If, however, the loss that it would be
able to inflict upon the enemy were only equal to
the loss that the British would inflict upon it, then
it would be a bad investment, or at least, an investment
without profit, for the reason that, in
war, it is poor policy to risk the destruction of
a valuable war-engine merely for the destruction
of what may be termed non-belligerent property
of an enemy, such as the dwellings of the inhabitants
of a city.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that a couple of Zeppelins
should be able to destroy houses in a British
town having a value ten times as great as the
value of one of the Zeppelins, and, in the attack,
should lose one of the Zeppelins, it would not be
a profitable raid, for a Zeppelin, being useful for
scouting purposes, is a potential factor in deciding
the issue of the war, whereas the houses
have practically no bearing on the issue of the
war.</p>

<p>It is good policy to use both men and machinery
of war only for the destruction of men
and machinery of an enemy, and not for the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>struction
of non-combatant inhabitants and property.</p>

<p>Much has been said about gun-fire from air-craft
upon underlying troops. A man standing
on the earth, being seen endwise, presents a much
smaller target to the vertical fire of the air-man
than he presents when fired at horizontally from
the earth, because in the one case he is seen end-to,
and in the other case side-to. Besides, several
other men may be exposed to the horizontal fire.
The air-man, however, is a conspicuous target, and
if his machine is hit and crippled the result is
fatal to him.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Aëroplane and Dirigible Compared</span></p>

<p>As I have for many years predicted, the chief
use of air-craft, whether aëroplane or dirigible
balloon, is for purposes of reconnaissance.</p>

<p>This war has amply demonstrated the fact that
air-craft are of enormous value. They have rendered
surprises in force practically impossible.
Each side has been able to keep itself fully aware
of the numbers and disposition of opposing
troops.</p>

<p>The aëroplane costs but a fraction of what the
Zeppelin costs, while the Zeppelin presents a
target enormously larger. It constitutes a target
so big as to make the broad side of a barn blush
with envy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>As one effective hit will bring down either aëroplane
or Zeppelin alike, obviously, the aëroplane
has the advantage over the Zeppelin, as a target,
equal to the difference in size multiplied by the
difference in cost. Furthermore, the aëroplane is
far more mobile and more rapid in flight than the
Zeppelin.</p>

<p>In judging of the value of the Zeppelin for purposes
of reconnaissance on land, as compared with
the aëroplane, we must take into account the fact
that a large number of aëroplanes can be built
for the cost of a single Zeppelin, and manned with
the crew of a single Zeppelin, and that these many
aëroplanes, operating in concert, will be able to
do much more effective work than one Zeppelin.</p>

<p>If the Allies would be good enough not to shoot
at them, Zeppelins might be very efficient indeed,
hovering along the battle-front. These dirigibles
have been very conspicuous for their absence
from the battle-front in the war.</p>

<p>The use of the Zeppelin as a troop-ship has yet
to be proven, and its value for the purpose will
depend upon how it compares with the aëroplane
for the same purpose. Aëroplanes capable of carrying
at least a dozen soldiers each, with the arms
and equipment of a raider's outfit, can now be
built. Obviously, as a large number of such aëroplanes
can be built at the cost of a single Zeppelin,
and as the aëroplane can travel even faster than
the Zeppelin, the Zeppelin cannot for one moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
compare with the aëroplane, even for the purpose
of carrying troops.</p>

<p>There is one purpose, however, for which the
Zeppelin is admirably adapted, where it is much
superior to the aëroplane, and it is for reconnaissance
over sea. The Zeppelin can hang on the
sky and scan the sea as a hawk scans a field for
its prey; and as it can carry a wireless apparatus
capable of transmitting messages to a distance of
two hundred miles or more, it can keep the German
fleet constantly informed of the positions of
the British fleet in the near seas. It is thus able
to direct a sortie of ships when the numbers and
disposition of the enemy's ships are such as to
insure success.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin has also a very important use in
the detection of submarines, for the reason that
from a vertical position submarines, under favorable
conditions, can easily be seen at considerable
depths below the surface, and the Zeppelin, with
its long-range wireless, is able promptly to report
such valuable information.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the Germans have
planned and built their Zeppelins mainly for oversea
fighting against England, and for a prospective
invasion of England. I think they must have
been disappointed in the lack of destructiveness
that their bombs have had when dropped from
Zeppelins, while the moral effect on England must
also have been disappointing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>From the point of German advantage, it would
be a good plan to frighten the British if it would
take the fight out of them, but it is a very bad
plan to frighten the British if it puts more fight
into them. The Zeppelin raids have certainly had
the effect of stimulating the British fighting spirit.</p>

<p>It is especially regrettable that the United
States Government did not heartily co-operate
with the Wright Brothers to lead the world in
the development of the aëroplane; but nothing of
the sort was done. "We have," as Congressman
Gardner says, "been experimenting and expecting
and reporting and contracting and considering&mdash;in
fact, we have been doing everything except
building aëroplanes."</p>

<p>The Wright Brothers, however, were received
with glad foreign embrace. They were generously
encouraged abroad, both by co-operative and competitive
experiments and by liberal purchases.
The result was that, on the breaking out of the
European War, France, for example, had 1,400
aëroplanes, while the United States had but
twenty-three, mostly obsolete. The United States
Government has followed its time-honored custom
of allowing its naval and military inventions to
be developed and perfected abroad before adoption
here.</p>

<p>Prior to the outbreak of the European War,
this government ordered from abroad an up-to-date
French aëroplane with two Salmson motors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and one of the latest German aëroplanes with two
Mercedes motors, with the intention of building
a few of these machines. Then came the European
War. The American purchases were commandeered,
and we were thereby prevented from
acquiring the much-desired air-craft.</p>

<p>The de Bange obturator, an indispensable part
of the breech mechanism of all large guns, was
originally an American invention, but this Government
allowed it to be developed and perfected
abroad and given a foreign name.</p>

<p>Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i> was taken up by Europeans,
right where its private builders left it, and it has
been developed, mainly in England, into the modern
super-dreadnought.</p>

<p>The interchangeable system of manufacture of
small arms was developed and perfected in America,
but received no encouragement from the government.
This system is now universally employed
in the manufacture of small arms, and also
in the manufacture of all kinds of machinery. It
is for this reason that we are able to get a spare
part for an automobile that will fit in place perfectly
without having it specially made. Before
the advent of the interchangeable system of manufacture
of firearms, a sportsman in England went
to his gunsmith to be measured for a shotgun just
as he went to his tailor to be measured for a suit of
clothes. At that time, no two guns were made
exactly alike, and no piece of one gun would fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
any other gun, while now all the parts of one gun
will fit in the places of corresponding parts in
every other gun of the same pattern.</p>

<p>The year the United States Government
adopted multi-perforated smokeless powder, Congress
appropriated only $30,000 for smokeless
powder, the orders to be divided among the different
manufacturers. This meant that inventors,
like myself, who had started in a small way, were
driven out of business. I went to England with
my multi-perforated smokeless-powder grain,
which had been adopted by the United States
Government, but found it hard to get foreign
manufacturers to recognize either the superiority
of the multi-perforated grain or of the pure nitro-cellulose
powder. The excessive erosion, however,
of guns used in the present war, due to the use
of powders containing a high percentage of nitroglycerin,
is already making those countries using
nitroglycerin powders look longingly to the superior
smokeless powder used in the United
States.</p>

<p>The United States Government has as yet taken
no steps worth considering toward the obtainment
of Zeppelins, or any other practical dirigible balloon.
At the present time, there is not one in the
American service.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities abroad, France
had 22 dirigibles and 1,400 aëroplanes; Russia,
18 dirigibles and 800 aëroplanes; Great Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
9 dirigibles and 400 aëroplanes; Belgium, 2
dirigibles and 100 aëroplanes; Germany, 40
dirigibles and 1,000 aëroplanes; Austria, 8 dirigibles
and 400 aëroplanes; while the United States
had, as I have mentioned, only 23 aëroplanes,
mostly obsolete.</p>

<p>Last year, the Secretary of the Navy appointed
a Board to investigate the subject of aviation for
the Navy, and to make recommendations. The
Board recommended the appropriation of $1,300,000
for that year, but Congress cut off the first
left-hand numeral and appropriated the sum of
$350,000 for the purpose.</p>

<p>The present war has demonstrated that air-craft
are the eyes of both armies and navies. If
the Wright Brothers could have come to the country's
aid in the Spanish War, the American fleet
would not have remained in doubt outside Santiago
Harbor. Before the advent of aviation, one
of the chief desiderata to a commanding officer
was to find out what the enemy was doing behind
the hill. Without the aëroplane, it is impossible
to prevent surprises in force, and to avoid the
deadly ambuscade. The aëroplane is absolutely
indispensable for the location of masked batteries.
It is impossible, without aëroplanes, even to approximate
the number and disposition of troops to
which an army may be opposed. It is necessary
to have not only a sufficient number of aëroplanes,
especially designed and equipped for this pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>pose,
but also other aëroplanes, armed and
equipped, to co-operate with them, and defend
them against attack from the aëroplanes of the
enemy. Just as dreadnoughts require battle-cruisers,
and both require torpedo-boat destroyers,
and all require other scout-ships and submarines,
for co-operation against a fleet of an
enemy, so do dirigibles and the different types
of aëroplanes, according to their purpose, require
one another for concert of action.</p>

<p>What we have already seen of battles fought
in the sky leads us to surmise that aërial battles
of the future will be fought on a much larger
scale. It will be found that the commander who
expects to conquer the ground held by an enemy
must first conquer the sky. Aviation carries war
into the third dimension.</p>

<p>Not only must the advance or retirement of
troops be supported by artillery thundering from
hill to hill, but also the troops must be supported
and guided by pilots in the sky.</p>

<p>The last Congress appropriated $1,000,000 for
the aviation purposes of the Navy. It is the same
million dollars that was cut from last year's appropriation,
which ought to have been expended
for the purpose during that period.</p>

<p>It is a strange paradox that America, which
has led the world in discovery and invention as
applied to the industrial arts and sciences, should
follow the rest of the world in their adoption by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the Army and Navy. The trouble is not with the
bureaus and boards of the Army and Navy, which
have merely the power to recommend such things,
but it is the fault of Congressional false economy.
As long as we allow other nations to lead us, both
in the character and quantity of naval and military
equipment, we are destined always to be
weaker than other nations in that equipment; consequently,
when war comes, we spend money with
the extravagance of frenzy to remedy the defect.
We economized before the War of 1812, and during
that war we wasted ten times as much as we
had saved by our economy. We had disqualified
ourselves by our economies to such an extent before
the outbreak of the great Civil War that this
conflict became one of the most deadly and most
expensive in the history of the world. What we
saved by our economies, compared to what we
lost by them on that occasion is like a drop of
water to a river of water. But we failed to profit
by the experience, and, when the Spanish War
broke out, we spent money with all the lavishness
of prodigal inefficiency.</p>

<p>If we could only be as wise as we have been
lessoned by our sad experience, we would immediately
take adequate measures to forefend ourselves
against a repetition of such experiences;
and one of those measures would be the building
of an aërial fleet commensurate with our large
needs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>OUR ARMAMENTS NOT A BURDEN</h3>


<p>Life being a reaction between the individual
and environing stimuli, it naturally follows
that those stimuli not destructive are necessarily
formative.</p>

<p>The health and development of nations are governed
by the same law that governs the health and
development of individuals. When an individual
is subjected to a burden that does not break him,
or to a trial that he is able to master, he is
strengthened, not weakened, by the burden or the
trial. Every individual is constantly being attacked
by microbes of disease. So long as he possesses
sufficient powers of resistance to repel
invasion of disease, his ability to resist disease is
strengthened, and his immunity to further attacks
is increased. It is only when disease gets inside
a man that it becomes a destroyer.</p>

<p>It is not a bad thing for a hen, but, on the contrary,
it is a very good thing for a hen to lay eggs
and sit on them and hunger for three weeks in
order to hatch the chicks, and then to scratch for
them and hunt for them until they are able to take
care of themselves. She is stronger, healthier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
more intelligent, more competent, and altogether
a better hen because of her exertion and her sacrifice.
The rearing of her chicks imposes no burden
on the farmer, because she gets the wealth for
their growth out of the ground.</p>

<p>The human mother who bears and rears sons
and daughters is supremely rewarded for all the
pain and the burden. The husband and wife who
toil for each other and their children are able to
arrive thereby, and only thereby, at most complete
living and the goal of supreme happiness. Happiness
is our sense of the normal exercise of faculty;
consequently happiness is the feel of normal life;
unhappiness the feel of abnormal life.</p>

<p>Just as we are strengthened by bearing all burdens
that are not so heavy as to crush us beneath
their weight, so the nation is enriched by the burdens
it bears and the expenditures it makes for
the general welfare of its people. We may help
our understanding of this matter by recognizing
the truth that everything primarily comes out of
the ground, and that whatever comes out of the
ground, whether from agriculture or mining, is
newly-created wealth. Whatever stimulates a
more active development of our natural resources
produces accordingly a proportionate amount of
new wealth.</p>

<p>The people have been taught, until the belief is
now well-nigh universal, that the cost of establishing,
equipping, maintaining, and supporting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
standing army, the cost of building, manning, and
supporting a large navy, and the expense of manufacturing
and storing large supplies of ammunition
and other war-materials, represent just so
much dead loss to the taxpayers of the country.</p>

<p>It is necessary to correct this error, and to disseminate
the truth that the building of battleships,
the manufacture of arms and ammunition,
the manufacture of supplies of food and clothing,
require large numbers of laborers and
skilled artisans, who become a great market for
food and supplies of every description for their
convenience and comfort, thereby giving employment
to myriads of others, back to the farmer;
while the money paid for wages and produce is
kept constantly in circulation.</p>

<p>It is the difficulty of paying taxes from the
pockets of poverty that makes taxes burdensome,
and not their size. If the ability to pay a given
amount in tax be tripled, the tax itself may be
doubled, and the taxpayers still be the gainers.</p>

<p>Wealth is what labor gets out of the ground;
and whatever stimulates labor, or creates a demand
for labor, is a direct stimulus to prosperity,
by increasing both the number of laborers and the
hours of labor, and by affording a market for
the products of labor.</p>

<p>If all of those thrown out of positions in a panic
were to be put to work by the government in
the production of war-materials, there would re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>sult
no hard times, and the entire country would
be better off.</p>

<p>The large standing army indispensable to Germany
costs vast sums annually, but the standard
of personal efficiency is raised so much by military
training, and industry is so stimulated to
meet government requirements, that the Germans
have captured markets all over the world for the
sale of their manufactured products in ever-increasing
quantities.</p>

<p>According to statistics, we Americans spend
every year on sensuous indulgence, on our hilarities&mdash;joy
food, joy drink, joy dope, and night-outings&mdash;nine
thousand million dollars, which, in
gold, would weigh more than thirteen thousand
tons&mdash;the weight of a good-sized battleship.</p>

<p>The biggest super-dreadnoughts cost $15,000,000
each, built in pairs; built a hundred at a time,
they certainly would not cost over $12,000,000
each. We could build, for what we spend on sensuous
indulgence, 750 super-dreadnoughts; we could
build 160 super-dreadnoughts a year for what we
spend on alcoholic beverages; 83 a year for what
we spend on tobacco; three a year for what we
spend on chewing-gum.</p>

<p>The total amount that we spend each year on
our Army and Navy is about $250,000,000. Consequently,
we spend more than twelve times as
much on alcoholic drinks and tobacco as we do on
our Army and Navy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not mean to preach a temperance sermon,
or to advise against the use of tobacco. Nevertheless,
I do think that for every dollar we spend
on indulgence, we might drop a couple of cents
into the side-till just for insurance&mdash;for the safety
of our country against war, in order that our joys
of living may be continued.</p>

<p>The small burden of armaments in proportion
to the burden of luxuries is very well stated in the
following quotation from "Some Economic
Aspects of War," by Professor C. Emery:&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Certainly Bloch is not likely to minimize the
extent of such expenditures, as he has been one of
the leading writers to show the immensity of
this burden, and yet he himself states that the
military expenditures of different European countries
vary from 2 per cent. to 3.8 per cent. of the
total income. Even Germany, with her great organization,
takes less than 3 per cent. of the actual
income for its maintenance, both of army and
navy; and when we think of the expenditures for
luxuries, many of them harmful in themselves,
the extent of military expenditures appears even
less. In Germany, for instance, three times as
much is spent for intoxicating drinks as for the
support of military and naval establishments.
One-third less consumption of beer and liquor on
the part of the German people would take care of
this part of the budget altogether.</i>"</p>

<p>There is no branch of insurance so important
as insurance against war. There is no other thing
insured, of which the loss is so vital as that of
one's country, and there is no kind of insurance

Insurance":&mdash;</p>

making a total of $112,850,000 expended for
premiums on crime insurance alone.... A total
annual amount on fire and crime insurance combined
is $594,186,104, or about 350 million more
than for all our military forces. Considering
these figures we may conclude that our military
expenditures are by no means greater than the
probable loss by a war; that they are small compared
with the amounts spent for fire and crime
insurance, and that the insurance rate is low compared
with that for other kinds of insurance in
effect in the business world.</i>"</p>

<p>During periods of peace, there tends to be established
an equilibrium of supply and demand between
our developed industries and our undeveloped
resources. Consequently, when war comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and stimulates enormously all our developed industries&mdash;arts,
sciences, and manufactures&mdash;a
correspondingly greater demand is placed upon
our natural resources, and their development is
proportionately increased.</p>

<p>The result is that the nation as a whole is not
impoverished in the least by the burden of armaments,
but is rather benefited by their support.
Also, a nation may likewise be economically benefited
by actual war, so long as it has such resources,
number of population, industrial arts and
sciences, and naval and military equipment as to
prevent subjugation and the humiliation and degradation
of being forced to pay ransom or tribute
in the shape of a large war indemnity to a foreign
Power.</p>

<p>The fact that a war indemnity takes gold out
of the country, and gives it to another people,
makes the indemnity a national calamity. But
when money is spent within the country, as it is
for armaments, the condition is entirely different.</p>

<p>The following excerpt from "The Valor of
Ignorance," by General Homer Lea, admirably
presents this:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Budgets are but the sums total of the symbols
of wealth. Whether they are great or small, the
wealth of the nation varies not one potato. An individual
measures his wealth by coinage, but a
nation only by that which coinage represents.</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

<p>"<i>As a man squanders his money, he becomes
impoverished; but it is only when the resources
and means of producing that which money represents
are destroyed or diminished that the wealth
of a nation is lessened. The armament of a nation,
instead of being indicative of its impoverishment,
is rather an indication of its capacity.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>It is a law of psychology that, when we are
subjected to a supreme test, we develop unrealized
resources within ourselves; resources that never
would be developed, nor could be, except through
such trial. By consequence, it is evident that
supreme trial is an indispensability to the best
development of either individuals or nations.
However severe may be the trial that results in
the supreme development of the natural resources
of the nation, and of the dormant resources in
its people, it is essentially beneficial to the nation.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer said that, just as it is impossible
to get a five-fingered hand into a three-fingered
glove, with a separate finger in each
pocket, so it is impossible to get a complex thought
into a mind not sufficiently complex to receive it.
It is doubtless impossible, therefore, to prove to
the pacifist mind that the money spent in building
warships cannot be counted as so much loss to the
nation.</p>

<p>The money spent by the government in building
fighting-ships could not be esteemed so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
money lost, even if the ships were useless. The
government taxes the people for the money to
build the ships, and then pays the money back
to the people again for the ships. The people get
their money all back, and the government gets
the ships. The people lose nothing, and the government
is the gainer to the value of the ships. It
may be argued that the labor of the people is lost,
but what of it? Labor is neither money nor
wealth; it merely represents time. It does not
hurt the laborers to do the work; on the contrary,
it does them good. They pay but an infinitesimal
part of the tax for building the ships. Their occupation
constitutes them a market for manufactured
articles and farm produce, which pays the
manufacturers and the farmers a profit far in excess
of their part of the tax for the ships, since
by the increased demand they both get better
prices and sell more goods. The farmer exerts
additional effort to supply the demand, for the
laborers who build the ships, and the manufacturers
who supply their wares, call upon the
farmer for greater supplies of produce than they
could call for if the fighting-ships were not built.
The farmer, always glad to get more out of the
ground when he can sell to advantage, is stimulated
to extra effort to get the greater profit, and
he is made richer for it. The manufacturer is
made richer for it, and the laborer is helped by
higher wages and by more continuous occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The result is that the fighting-ships have cost
nothing. On the contrary, their production has
benefited all. Everybody is made better and
richer through the building of them.</p>

<p>It is especially significant and pertinent that
the added employment of labor in the construction
of armaments adds greatly to the number of taxpayers.
Consequently, the burden of taxation is
thereby borne by a larger number of persons,
with a corresponding lessening of the burden on
each individual. This is one of the reasons why
poverty is not increased by increased government
expenditures in the employment of labor.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of life being derived entirely
from exercise of our faculties, the more useful
exercise we get within our strength, the happier
we are. The building of battleships, by putting
us more to use, serves the double purpose of getting
more wealth out of the ground and making
us happier. It may be argued that this would
not be true if our economic institutions were not
slack, and that, by perfecting these institutions,
every one would receive his due amount of normal
stimulus, and would be getting out of the ground
his normal amount of wealth. This is all very
true, but our economic institutions are not yet
perfected, and the cost of building battleships
comes out of the slack in our institutions. The
work merely helps take up some of the slack.</p>

<p>When we have looked upon our Navy, remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>bering
what the pacifists have told us about its
enormous cost, we are strongly impressed with
the colossal expenditure, not realizing that the
Navy has actually cost nothing. Its production
has been a source of profit and benefit to the
people.</p>

<p>That which determines the size of a burden is
the ability to bear it. Our burden of armaments,
borne upon the united backs of a hundred million
people, with an aggregate wealth of more
than a hundred and thirty billion dollars, with an
annual increase of wealth of over four billion dollars,
becomes insignificant compared with the
ability to support it. Size, like distance and time,
has no meaning, except in a relative sense, for
space and time are limitless. As compared with
space, a mustard seed is exactly as large as the
sun.</p>

<p>We hear much about the tremendous burden of
the present conflict upon the warring nations. The
pacifists tell us that they are destined so to exhaust
themselves that, when the war is over, we need
have no fear of any one of them, or of a coalition
of them, because they will have neither men nor
money with which to fight.</p>

<span class="caption">Enormous Resources of the Warring Nations</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>The first six months of the war cost about six
billion dollars. Now, assuming that the first year
of the war should cost even as much as fifteen billion
dollars, this would be only five per cent. of the
wealth of the warring Powers. But, it must be remembered,
that the same thing largely holds true
in the case of war that holds true in the case of
armaments in time of peace. The cost comes out
of the ground, for the most part. In short, the
wealth created by the added stimulus in great
measure compensates for the loss, especially when
the money spent is chiefly returned to the people
themselves. The actual out-of-pocket loss to the
nations in the present war, taking into account its
economic advantages, even during the war, will
probably not exceed two and a half per cent., and
I doubt if it will amount to that much.</p>

<p>The total number of killed and wounded in the
European War during the first six months is estimated
at about two million. Most of those
wounded will suffer very little permanent injury.</p>

<p>The population of the warring nations is more
than four hundred millions, taking into account
only such part of the vast Indian population in
proportion to the percentage of troops furnished
by them as compares with the percentage furnished
from the United Kingdom to the number of
its inhabitants. Consequently, the total loss in
killed and wounded during the first six months of
the war was less than a half of one per cent. of the
population, and as the number of killed does not
exceed ten per cent. of the total number of killed
and wounded, the loss during the first six months
was about a tenth of half of one per cent.; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
other words, only about a twentieth of one per
cent.</p>

<p>After the war has run for a year, the total loss
in killed and wounded will not exceed one per cent.
of the inhabitants, and the total in killed will not
exceed a tenth of one per cent.</p>

<p>When the war is over, any one of the warring
Powers, unless Germany is exceedingly humbled,
will be in better condition in every way to fight
us than it would have been before the war broke
out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>EGO-FANATIC GOOD INTENTIONS AND
THEIR RELATION TO NATIONAL DEFENSE</h3>

<blockquote><p>"If you will study history you will find that freedom, when it has
been destroyed, has always been destroyed by those who shelter
themselves under the cover of its forms, and who speak its language
with unparalleled eloquence and vigor."&mdash;<i>Lord Salisbury.</i></p>

<p>There is a no more consistent thing in its constancy than human
inconsistency.</p></blockquote>


<p>Many of those who are most pretentious
about the virtue of a meek and lowly spirit
manifest characteristics the exact opposite
of their self-vaunted pretensions. Often the
most enthusiastic and devout workers for a principle
are themselves, when put to trial, most pronounced
violators of that principle.</p>

<p>Some years ago, while on ship for England, I
formed the acquaintance of Sir William Wyndeer,
of Australia. He told me that there was a famous
woman pacifist on board, who wanted to meet me.
She was a notorious militant moral reformer&mdash;the
Carrie Nation of England. I went with him
to where she was sitting on the deck in a steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>chair,
and, on being introduced, sat down beside
her.</p>

<p>She opened the conversation with the remark:
"Do you know that men like you ought to be
hanged; that hanging is too good for you; that
men like you, who invent and make explosives and
guns to kill people, ought to be killed with them
yourselves? That would give you a dose of your
own medicine."</p>

<p>I replied by asking her what she thought of the
Armenian atrocities, which were at that time being
perpetrated.</p>

<p>"What do I think of them?" she answered. "I
think just this&mdash;that, if I were the Queen of England,
I would put an end to that business pretty
quick."</p>

<p>"How would you do it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why," she responded, "I would go there
with an army, and exterminate those beastly
Turks."</p>

<p>"If you were to do that," said I, "surely you
would need some of the tools for killing people,
like those you blame me for inventing, would you
not?"&mdash;She would not speak to me after that.</p>

<p>In the Dark Ages, they who were responsible
for inflicting upon heretics the most exquisite tortures,
were the foremost good-intentionists of
their time. They believed they were following the
teachings of Christ, and applying them in their
business and social relations. Their aim was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
practise what they preached: "Love one another,"
"Love thy neighbor as thyself," "On earth peace,
good will toward men."</p>

<p>So imbued were they with what they conceived
to be divine principles that it was self-evident to
them that there was no excuse for any one holding
any other opinion than theirs, and that any one
who held a different opinion was an enemy of
God and man, and should be punished accordingly.
They called difference from their opinion
heresy, which was branded as the most heinous of
all crimes. Those good-intentionists of the Torquemada
type racked, flayed, and burned, with a
meek and lowly spirit, for the love of God. The
horror of St. Bartholomew was to them merely a
frolic of brotherly love.</p>

<p>Advocates of disarmament, non-resistance, and
the subversion of the military spirit are themselves
most militant creatures. They fail to see
that, if retiring, non-resistant pacifism is the best
policy for a nation to adopt in order to get what
it wants, they themselves should adopt such pacifism
to get what they want. While they decry
every manner of aggression, still they undertake
to enforce their doctrines by most aggressive practices.</p>

<p>Never in all human history has any person or
class of persons attempted to proselyte others to
a doctrine of mildness, meekness, self-sacrifice,
and lowly-spiritedness without attempting to en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>force
the doctrine. In so doing, the practice has
been the exact opposite of the preachment.</p>

<p>Robespierre and Marat notably exemplified this
truth. Before the French Revolution, Robespierre
was noted as a pacifist of the most pretentious
cheek-turning type, and Marat was a pacific moralist
dyed in the wool. When raised to dictatorial
power, however, Robespierre became the wickedest
and most venomous of all the fanged monsters
of cruelty in the history of mankind; while bloody
Marat, clothed with authority, used murder as
the sole means of reform. The actions of Robespierre
and Marat were the exact opposite of their
code for the conduct of others.</p>

<p>The advocates of non-resistance may be perfectly
conscientious. It is not to be doubted for
one moment that the majority of them are actuated
by the best intentions and the kindliest of motives.
Torquemada sincerely hoped to do a great
good by torturing heretics in the Spanish Inquisition.
He is notable among those who have paved
broad highways of Hell with good intentions.</p>

<p>The hyper-sentimental pacifists are today actively
engaged in paving a broad highway through
this country, over which the hell of war is invited
by them.</p>

<p>Devotion to the end justified the means to such
a well-meaning fanatic as Torquemada. The same
was doubtless true of Catherine de' Medici, who
mothered the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
bloody Duke of Alva, Executioner Extraordinary
to Philip II of Spain, who undertook the task of
killing the entire population of the Netherlands,
because their religious opinion differed from the
Spanish brand, could not have been so enthusiastically
devoted to the monstrous villainy had he
not been inspired by what was to his mind the
best of intentions.</p>

<p>It is remarkable what an influence a very little
thing may sometimes have in shaping the policy
of a people or the fate of a nation. Religious
sects have been formed upon the various interpretations
of a single phrase; a difference of opinion
about the meaning of a word has set them at one
another's throats.</p>

<p>Millions upon millions of dollars have been
spent in the United States in peace propagandism,
and eloquent lungs have hoarsed themselves to
defeat Congressional appropriations for defense,
simply because the phrase, <i>preparation for war</i>,
has been used instead of the phrase, <i>preparation
against war</i>.</p>

<p>An organization of American women, under the
head, Woman's Peace Party, has lately been created.
The main resolution adopted by the organization
is the following:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Resolved:</i></p>

<p>"<i>That we denounce with all the earnestness of
which we are capable the concerted attempt now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
being made to force this country into still further
preparedness for war. We desire to make a solemn
appeal to the higher attributes of our common
humanity to help us unmask this menace to our
civilization.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>They have made the grave mistake of using the
expression for <i>war</i> in place of the expression
<i>against war</i>.</p>

<p>The pacifist propagandists, the army and navy
men, and all their friends and supporters, are alike
agreed that it is wise to make efficient preparations
<i>against</i> war. None of us wants war, but
when we, who believe in armaments, speak of them
as preparations <i>for</i> war, then the pacifists are in
immediate disagreement with us. Let us, therefore,
in future substitute the phrase <i>against war</i>
for the phrase <i>for war</i>.</p>

<p>Among the organizers of this so-called party
are women of national prominence. They are sincere
in their purpose, their aim is high. They are
emulating the dictum of Emerson, for they have
hitched their wagon to a star&mdash;Dr. David Starr&mdash;(never
mind the Jordan). They solemnly make
this pledge:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>We do hereby band ourselves together to demand
that war should be abolished.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is well to note that they have used the word
<i>should</i> instead of <i>shall</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest difficulty in teaching truth is to
remove the bias of false learning; for a firm conviction,
once established in the mind, gives the
mind a fixed set in a certain direction. This is
strongly exemplified by the fact that persons who
have been proselyted to a certain religious creed
can seldom be made to change their faith.</p>

<p>We are what our opinions are. Our opinion
shapes our destiny to its own bent. In short, a
man is absolutely at the mercy of his opinion.</p>

<p>We have very little to do, however, with the
shaping of our own opinion. That is mostly
shaped by others. We go to church to have our
opinion bent, or its present bent stiffened. We
attend a lecture and get a new kink put into our
opinion; we converse with our friends, and they
dent our opinion; we read books and newspapers,
learn something, and are swerved in the direction
of our learning, especially in the direction of
public opinion. Always and always, while we
think that we are shaping our own opinion, we
are having it shaped by others.</p>

<p>The estimable ladies of the Woman's Peace
Party are merely parading like sandwich men, disporting
a legend written on a board by the man
higher up, with whom they believe it is most
creditable to agree.</p>

<p>At the present time, the false teachings of the
peace-propagandists have so proselyted public
opinion that every public speaker, aspiring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
popular favor, finds it easy, even with a weakling
voice and a halting speech, to get his audience
with him, and to win a reputation for eloquence
and wisdom by prating the bromidial spielings of
the peace-propagandists.</p>

<p>A great many men and women in this country
hold the same false opinion that the ladies of the
Woman's Peace Party hold. Possibly something
besides the humiliation of this country by war
may lead them into the light of understanding.
War, however, will do it, and by their able co-operation
with the forces of the future enemies of
the country, they are hastening the advent of that
war.</p>

<p>If we were to disarm, as these ladies advise, war
would come upon us with consternate suddenness.
Then, when they saw the desolation and the waste;
saw their homes in flames; when they saw innocent
citizens clumped in open spaces and shot down
with machine-guns; when they saw little children,
lean as shadows, starving everywhere; when they
encountered insult and maltreatment at every
turn; then all their womanhood would revolt and
rise up with an altered mind.</p>

<p>Like the light that descended from Heaven on
Saul of Tarsus, the light of the truth would descend
on those ladies through the smoke of their
burning homes&mdash;that armed preparedness against
such a dread eventuality as war is the supreme
of virtue, and its neglect the worst of crimes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>By their help that war is very likely to come,
and if it does come, we shall find them, as the
women of England, ministering angels in the hospitals
of the wounded. We shall find them at the
recruiting stations, urging enlistment. We shall
find them fitting out their sons, husbands, and
brothers for the front. We shall find them, as in
England, training in the use of arms as a last
emergency reserve. We shall find them, as in England,
doing police duty, that the city guardians
may go to the front. As the women of Carthage
cut the hair from their heads to make bow-strings,
so these very women of the Peace Party, as the
women of England are doing, as the women of
Germany are doing, will sacrifice their jewelry,
and all their most precious possessions, to supply
the sinews of war.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that, because men
bear arms in war, they are the chief sufferers in
war, or make the chief sacrifices. The sexes suffer
equally, for to win victory they make mutual and
equal sacrifices, and in defeat they suffer mutually
every conceivable and every inconceivable laceration
of body, pride, and honor.</p>

<p>The supposition is erroneous that woman is less
brave or less militant in war than man. In times
of peace, when her help is not needed in the
sterner affairs of life, she may be as gentle as a
dove and as kind as a purring kitten; but, when
her help is needed in stern affairs, she is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
found wanting. When the cubs are in danger,
"the female of the species is more deadly than
the male."</p>

<p>The abject condition of Belgian women and children
since the German invasion is merely typical
of what women and children must inevitably suffer
at the hands of invaders. It matters not whether
a country be invaded by Germans, Frenchmen, or
Englishmen, or by Americans. The stern exigencies
of war require that the invaders shall bend
every energy and employ every resource to the
attainment of the main purpose&mdash;victory. The invaders
themselves are compelled to make extreme
sacrifices, and to bear extreme suffering and privation,
and are not in a mood to take on more burden
or to suffer extra privations, and, above all, to
risk success, in order to alleviate the suffering of
the enemy's women and children. Sympathy and
mercy, however, do often lead them to be far
kinder than would best suit the demands of stern
necessity.</p>

<p>It was when Sherman found himself compelled
to drive out the civil inhabitants of Atlanta, to
prepare for his march to the sea, that in reply to
protests on behalf of the women and children, he
made his world-famous declaration, "War is hell;
and we cannot civilize it or refine it."</p>

<p>The supreme duty of a nation is to safeguard
its people from such a crisis and such a calamity.
It is useless to lament the miseries of our women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and children, after we have, through neglect of
national defenses, brought the calamities of war
upon them.</p>

<p>With strange inconsistency, the women of the
Woman's Peace Party, though they bemoan the
lot of the poor women and children of Belgium,
are by their own acts inviting the same calamity
to fall upon themselves and on their children.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer observed that individual life
is a tendency to establish an equilibrium between
internal and external forces. This observation
applies also to the life of social organizations,
except that, when applied to nations, it should be
differently stated, as follows&mdash;the life of a nation
is the tendency to establish an equilibrium between
internal forces, and also between those
forces and external forces.</p>

<p>Opposing forces separately tend toward instability
of equilibrium, but collectively, by operating
against one another, they tend to the establishment
of an equilibrium. Individual action in a group
of individuals tends to heterogeneity, aggregated
action to homogeneity. One of the mainsprings
of progress is the pertinacity of enthusiasts and
faddists. Even the self-appointed ego-fanatic
moral reformers are often useful, because they
tend to throw society out of balance. This rouses
the great mass of the people to inquiry and raises
them to a broader understanding, with the result
that, in the end, pernicious propagandists, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
have overshot the mark, are brought back nearer
the mark, and the sane mass of the people brought
nearer the mark. A fanatic reformer sometimes
injects dynamic force into a static condition. It
seems to be a rational assumption, therefore, that,
in all things where organized feminist fanaticism
of both men and women is today working evil, the
great body of sane and normal men and women
ought to exert their united influence to the full as
a stabilizer, or equilibrator of the social organization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL CLASS?</h3>

<blockquote><p>"Probably the most curious feature of the naval program is
the regularity with which the sky clouds over as the day for the
consideration of naval appropriations approaches. Year after
year, after a long spell of pleasant weather, all at once storm
clouds have drifted across the heavens, international relations
have become suddenly strained, and the whole land has lain in
the shadow of an impending conflict. Fortunately, the storm
blows over as soon as the votes are counted, and in the beautiful
sunlight which follows the storm, workmen are seen constructing
additional battleships. Suspicious persons have occasionally
imagined they saw a connection between the international
weather and the Navy League."</p>

<p>
<i>Dr. David Starr Jordan, "War and Waste.</i>"<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>The pacifists have delved out of the infinite
latency a very startling alleged truth,
which they are effulging in language of
lavish luminosity, to the effect that it is necessary
only for a man to have a pecuniary interest or
personal advantage involved in order to commit
any kind of crime. They have discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
room for a motive establishes the motive and
proves the crime. They have discovered that
those things which we call integrity and honor
and conscience are no deterrents whatsoever to
the commission of the most heinous offense
against one's fellow men, so long as there is profit
in it. They believe that, if only there is money
in the game, an inventor or manufacturer or merchant
will scheme for the commission of wholesale
poisoning, maiming, and murder. They believe
that the inventors and manufacturers of
guns necessarily foster war in order to promote
the sale of their wares. They surmise that inventors
and manufacturers of smokeless powders
and high explosives are capable of standing with
the "black hand," capable of being gladdened at
the dynamite outrage, at the street riot, at the
slaughter of song-birds&mdash;anything that will consume
dynamite or burn gunpowder.</p>

<p>According to the pacifists, the principal lay of
makers of war-materials is to connive with the
officers of the Army and Navy to stir up international
dissension and foment war, in order to create
a demand for their products. The pacifists believe
that army and navy officers are only too
willing to co-operate in the nefarious business, because
war brings higher pay and rapid promotion.
They believe that it matters not to these "interested
parties" how many of their countrymen are
sacrificed on the firing line, or how many widows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and orphans are made. The groans of the
wounded and dying on the battle-field, and the
lamentations in the desolated home, are music to
the ears of those who supply the war-materials;
for, with every shot from a rifle, fifty grains of
gunpowder are burned, while bullets enough miss
their mark to equal the weight of each man they
kill. Consequently, there is substantial profit to
the cartridge-maker and the gunpowder-manufacturer
for every man killed with a rifle ball.</p>

<p>But it is in shrapnel and the ammunition for
the big guns that the greatest profit lies. Field-guns
fire away ammunition costing from ten to
twenty dollars a shot, at the rate of from twenty
to forty shots a minute. This costs a lot of money.
At the battle of Mukden, in the Russo-Japanese
war, one battery of eight guns fired 11,159 rounds,
or 1,395 rounds per gun. Think of the expense of
that ammunition, and the profit to the manufacturers!
It is estimated that when the big naval
guns are fired, the cost of the smokeless-powder
charge, the projectile and bursting charge, together
with the wear and tear of the gun, amounts
to more than $2,000 a shot, and the damage done
to a warship hit may be many millions.</p>

<p>Look at it any way you will, war, according to
the pacifist notion, is a real Klondike for manufacturers
of war-materials. The peace sophists
have been able to put two and two together, with
the conclusions that such an opportunity for profit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
is too strong for human nature to resist, and that,
as they have found room for the motive, they have
proved the crime.</p>

<p>Of course, their accusation is a pretty severe
arraignment of human nature, after all these
years of civilization and Christian enlightenment.</p>

<p>It is strange how human nature can have improved
so much lately, as claimed by the pacifists,
and how the spirit of brotherhood and good-will
can have suddenly become so dominant that the
peoples of the earth now despise war, and are so
afflicted with the horrors of it that, just as soon
as the great European War is over, they are not
going to fight any more, while still the makers of
war-materials remain in the primitive savagery
of the stone age. It seems to me that, if human
nature has so improved as to be an efficient bar
to a nation against waging war for plunder, regardless
of the advantage and the profit, it ought
also to be a similar bar to inventors and manufacturers
of war-materials, and to army and navy
officers, against precipitating war for pecuniary
or personal advantage.</p>

<p>But, according to pacifist reasoning, those "interested
parties" are more endowed with the
spirit of the hyena than with the spirit of brotherhood.
Perhaps, however, the manufacturers of
war-materials, and army and navy officers, were
not home when the great improvement in human
nature knocked at their door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>If considerations of mere personal profit are
sufficient to make the best of us foster war, which
the peace fanatics esteem wholesale murder, it is
strange that the inventors and manufacturers of
drugs and medicines, the proprietors of drugstores,
and the medical profession and undertakers,
do not form a league and co-operate in
spreading infectious diseases, in order to create
a greater demand for their wares and for their
services.</p>

<p>Of course, the reason may be that they have not
yet thought of it, and it may be wrong for me to
suggest the thing to them. Still, it is queer that
it has not been suggested to them by what the
pacifists have said concerning the conduct of our
army and navy officers and of the inventors and
manufacturers of war-materials.</p>

<p>Let us see what the facts actually are:</p>

<p>The inventors and manufacturers of war-materials,
and our army and navy officers, by virtue
of the study and experience that qualify them for
their business or profession better than others,
are also qualified better than others to judge what
are our actual needs for national defense.</p>

<p>If the manufacturers of war-materials, and our
army and navy men, are to be convicted of inciting
war on the evidence that by so doing they create
a demand for their services, then necessarily
others benefited by a like demand may be convicted
on the same evidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Carnegie himself is the greatest of
all American armorers. He it was who introduced
the Bessemer steel process into the United
States, from which all our gun-makers and all our
armament-makers have greatly benefited. It is
his name and that of Herr Krupp which Neptune
reads graven in the walls of fighting-ships. He
still draws an income from his interests in the
great armor-making steel corporation&mdash;an annual
income big enough to pay the combined salaries
of all the four thousand officers of the United
States Army.</p>

<p>Truly, if the discovery of room for a motive
proves both the motive and the crime, and is sufficient
to convict these four thousand men of being
willing to sell their souls in order to raise their
salaries a few dollars, Mr. Carnegie himself is at
least open to suspicion.</p>

<p>Likewise, the varied and many institutions&mdash;incubators
of the doves of peace&mdash;born of the
great armor-maker's generosity, which continue
to be his beneficiaries, cannot escape the suspicion
that taints their pedigree.</p>

<p>Even the leading man&mdash;the principal star on
the stage where <i>Uncle Sammy unter Alles</i> is being
played&mdash;Dr. David Starr Jordan, is paid from the
Carnegie Peace Foundation with money equally
tainted by the sweaty hands of the grimy men who
are forging armor-plate in the Smoky City.</p>

<p>But we all know that Mr. Carnegie is above any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
such suspicion. We know that the pacifist method
of reasoning must be false.</p>

<p>The education of our army and navy officers
teaches them not alone military science, but also
national devotion and personal honor. Devotion
to duty is necessary in order to keep them in the
service, under the altogether inadequate pay they
receive. The pay of the American army and navy
officers is smaller, in proportion to their knowledge
and the value of their services, than that of
any other class of men in the country. If every
army and navy officer should abandon the service
for a position in civil life when he could get a
raise of wages for so doing, there would not be
a corporal's guard left in the service.</p>

<p>Whenever a public work is placed in charge of
an army or navy officer, there is no <i>sub-rosa</i>
rake-off, or divvy with civilian contractors.
There is absolutely no graft of any kind in their
service, and the government is sure of getting the
maximum amount of work for the minimum cost.
Not one cent of graft has fallen upon the palms
either of Colonel Goethals or of any other army
officer in the whole course of construction of that
mighty work&mdash;the Panama Canal. New York City
tried to get Colonel Goethals as Police Commissioner.
He has received scores of offers of positions
in civil life at many times his present salary,
because of the military capacity and honor that
make the Goethals sort of service very valuable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>I know many army and navy men intimately.
I have had opportunities of hearing their off-guard
conversations and interchange of ideas on
all manner of subjects, and have thereby been enabled
to see their character revealed to the naked
soul, and I have never yet discovered any other
attitude or tendency among them than the emulation
of exactly that type of honor, efficiency, and
manhood which is Colonel Goethals'.</p>

<p>I cannot award this same high praise to the
politicians I have known.</p>

<p>An army or navy officer always drives just as
close a bargain as he can on behalf of the government
when doing business with civilians, although
the economics of the transaction is of no personal
concern to him.</p>

<p>When a politician makes a bargain, his first consideration
is: "Where do I come in?" His next
consideration is: "Where does the party come
in?" Duty to the government is a minor consideration.</p>

<p>It is the demand for a thing that leads to its
invention, just as it is the demand for a thing that
leads to its manufacture. The demand must precede
the production.</p>

<p>When the inventor designs a gun, or invents a
new explosive, he does not simultaneously try to
invent ways and means of creating a market. He
may, on the contrary, be inspired with a spirit
of patriotism, and feel that in the event of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
his work will be of signal service to his country,
both by killing his country's enemies and by saving
the lives of his own people.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of war-materials are much
more likely to be actuated by honorable motives,
and to make large sacrifices from a spirit of patriotism,
than are the manufacturers of soap, agricultural
machinery, or automobiles.</p>

<p>The builders of Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i> were not
able to get the government either to approve or
to back the enterprise. They were, however, fortunately
inspired by a high spirit of patriotism,
and by a strong belief in Ericsson's invention;
consequently, they built it at their own expense.
It was completed just in the nick of time. The
terrible <i>Merrimac</i> appeared before the <i>Monitor</i>
was quite ready. She could laugh at forts, and
the projectiles from the guns of our wooden navy
glanced off her mailed sides like raindrops off a
duck's back. Whether she would be able to run
up the Potomac and bombard Washington, was a
question only of the depth of water.</p>

<p>The little coterie of bureaucrats in Washington,
who had ridiculed the fantastic innovation of
Ericsson, were now on Uneasy Street, and sent
urgent appeals for the <i>Monitor</i> to be made ready
and sent to Hampton Roads with all speed. The
peculiar craft did arrive on the morning of the
second day of the naval fight. The result is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the good stories of history&mdash;a story that has
never been quite equaled in fiction.</p>

<p>The <i>Monitor</i> had not yet been accepted by
the government when she fought the <i>Merrimac</i>;
she had not yet received the government's approval.</p>

<p>A country Reuben, who saw a giraffe for the
first time at a circus, looked the animal over, and,
finding that it did not conform to his ideas of what
an animal ought to be, remarked, "By gum, there
ain't no sich critter!" Likewise, the naval experts
at Washington did not believe that there
could be any such fighting-ship. After that fight,
however, the <i>Monitor</i> was quickly purchased, and
hurried orders were given for more <i>Monitors</i>.</p>

<p>The patriotism and pluck of the warship-builders
saved the country.</p>

<p>The pacifists are strongly urging what they
term the nationalization of all manufacture of
war-materials; that is to say, that all such materials
should be made at government plants.
Their object is to have the work done by disinterested
persons, who will not be tempted to promote
war in order to make a market for those materials.
By admirable inconsistency, the pacifists would,
in so doing, place the manufacture of war-materials
in the hands of army and navy officers,
whom they pronounce the most pernicious of all
promoters of war.</p>

<p>Before Congress acts upon the suggestion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the pacifists to nationalize the manufacture of all
war-materials, it would be well to see what would
have happened in the past, had the thing been
done sooner. We can judge from that concerning
the advisability of adopting the measure now.</p>

<p>If it had been adopted at the time of the Civil
War, Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i> never would have been
built, because its building depended upon private
personal patriotism and private enterprise.</p>

<p>If the measure had been adopted twenty-five
years ago, then naturally, during that period, private
invention and private enterprise would have
been eliminated, and the government would not
have profited from civilian genius and energy.
Let us see, then, what private invention and private
enterprise have done for the government for
the past quarter-century, since the advent of
smokeless powder.</p>

<p>Colonel E. G. Buckner, vice-president of the
du Pont Powder Company, in an article in <i>Harper's
Weekly</i>, of June 27, 1914, places the credit
for the four most important inventions in the development
of smokeless powder&mdash;first, to Vieille,
of France, who produced gun-cotton; second, to
Mendeléeff, of Russia, who told us how to colloid
it; third, to Francis G. du Pont, who eliminated
danger in the manufacture; and, fourth, to Hudson
Maxim, who invented the multi-perforated
grain that gave absolute control over the
burning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that two of the most important
steps in the development of smokeless powder
were made by American civilian inventors. The
alcohol replacement invention of Francis G. du
Pont and my own invention of the multi-perforated
grain, rendered possible the use of a colloid
of pure nitro-cellulose as a smokeless cannon-powder.
It would be absolutely impossible successfully
to make a pure nitro-cellulose cannon-powder
without these two inventions. If the
manufacture of smokeless powder had been nationalized
twenty-five years ago, this government
would not stand, as it stands today, ahead of all
other governments, in the excellence of its smokeless
powder.</p>

<p>When the government first ordered a pure
nitro-cellulose powder, large quantities of solvents
were consumed in its preparation. Private manufacturers
introduced new processes to overcome
this difficulty, resulting in a material reduction in
the cost of the powder, which has already effected
a saving to the government of more than
$2,000,000.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of smokeless powder that,
regardless of however stable it may be when first
made, it gradually begins to decompose after long
standing, which, until recently, necessitated its destruction.
Several years ago, however, Mr.
Francis I. du Pont, son of the Francis G. du Pont
above-mentioned, invented a process for the suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>cessful
reworking of smokeless powder that has
begun to decompose, at a mere fraction of the
original cost, making it just as good as ever. This
invention alone will hereafter save the government
more than a million dollars a year.</p>

<p>When the new army rifle was developed, it was
found that the smokeless powder then used by the
army, containing nitro-glycerin, was so erosive as
to destroy the accuracy of the arm when only
1,600 rounds had been fired. The government obtained
from abroad some smokeless powder, which
enabled 3,000 rounds to be fired before the gun
was destroyed, but after that number of rounds,
the rifling was practically obliterated.</p>

<p>A private manufacturer invented a new smokeless
rifle-powder, with process and apparatus
for its manufacture. With this powder, it is now
possible to fire as high as 20,000 rounds before
the accuracy of the gun is destroyed. This invention
easily multiplies the life of the army rifle by
six. As the army rifle will now last six times as
long by the use of this powder as it would by
the use of any other powder, the value of the invention
to the government is by far the chief value
of the gun itself. Consequently, it is estimated
that this invention alone represents a value for
the guns that the government now has on hand
of more than $15,000,000.</p>

<p>Not only does our small-arms powder effect a
great saving in the wear and tear of our shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>rifles,
but also our pure nitro-cellulose cannon-powder
effects a similar saving in the life of our
big guns. Our big guns, using pure nitro-cellulose
powder, last, with equal accuracy, more than twice
as long as British guns, which use cordite.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing considerations
and figures that private genius and private
enterprise alone have saved the government very
many millions of dollars. Of course, it may be
argued that, since guns and ammunition and all
kinds of military implements and engines have
been perfected, there is not now room for civilian
inventors to be so useful to the government during
the next twenty-five years as they have been in
the past twenty-five.</p>

<p>A similar attitude of the average mind would
have existed had the same question been raised
twenty-five years ago. When our Patent Office
was first established, the Commissioner of Patents
predicted that within fifty years everything possible
of invention would have been invented and
that then the Patent Office would have to be abolished
for lack of business. The number of inventions
received by the Patent Office, however, has
rapidly increased, and is still rapidly increasing.
More inventions are received now each year at
the Patent Office than were received during the
first fifty years of its existence. The reason for
this is that every invention, either directly or
indirectly, creates a demand for other inventions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
The inventor is still working in virgin soil, and
the room for invention is infinite.</p>

<p>If the manufacture of war-materials were to be
nationalized, not only would the government rob
itself of the aid of large quasi-government manufactories,
but also it would rob itself of the benefits
of the inventive genius of the whole people.
The value of that genius may be approximated
by recalling what citizen inventions have done
since the outbreak of the American Civil
War.</p>

<p>Breech-loading guns of all kinds, the percussion
cap, cartridges for small-arms, fixed ammunition
for quick-firing guns, the breech mechanism for
all guns, the built-up gun, the great improvements
in steel manufacture, the revolving turret and the
<i>Monitor</i> type of fighting-ship, the steam turbine,
the internal-combustion engine, all of the great
inventions in smokeless powders and high explosives,
and their adaptability to use in ordnance,
the submarine torpedo-boat, the self-propelled torpedo,
the aëroplane and the dirigible, and any
number of other inventions indispensable to modern
warfare, have been the invention of civilians.
Of course, army and navy officers have invented
a great many important things themselves, and
have rendered great service in the development
of civilian inventions. But it must be remembered
that army and navy officers constitute but a very
small part of the population. Even were army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and navy men ten times more proficient in the
invention of war-materials than civilian inventors,
the number and value of civilian naval and military
inventions would preponderate enormously
over those of government officers.</p>

<p>We have been assured all along by the peace
sophists that, if war should come, the great American
genius would rise to the occasion and spring
to our rescue, with all manner of destructive contrivances,
capable of annihilating armies and
sweeping fleets of fighting-ships off the seas.</p>

<p>If the beautiful nationalization plan of the peace
sophists, however, were to be carried out, the
great American genius would get no opportunity
to fructify the prophesied militant cataclysmic
ogerism to the discomfiture of our enemies.</p>

<p>No other government has nationalized the manufacture
of armaments and war-materials to the
exclusion of private manufacturers. On the contrary,
other governments strongly encourage private
manufacture, for they realize the vast importance
of drawing upon the inventive genius of the
whole people, and of enlisting private energy, private
enterprise, and private capital in government
work.</p>

<p>The French government for more than a hundred
years has made all its own gunpowder, but
its chief gun-works are private enterprises. Possibly,
if the French smokeless powder had been
perfected by private enterprise to meet govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>ment
requirements, those requirements would
have been more exacting with private manufacturers
than with government manufacturers, and
the battleships <i>Jéna</i> and <i>La Liberté</i> would not
have been blown up by the spontaneous combustion
of bad gunpowder. If this government were
to nationalize the manufacture of its war-materials,
we know, by what has been done in the past,
through private enterprise and private inventive
genius, that the government would suffer enormously.</p>

<p>In this era of Congressional investigations, it
would be well to have a government inquiry made
as to whether or not there should be a new classification
of acts of treason. It should be inquired
whether or not, in time of peace, public preachments
should be allowed advocating the disbanding
of our Army and the destruction of our Navy&mdash;acts
which in time of war might be interpreted
as treason, and the offenders backed up against a
wall and shot. It should be inquired whether or
not foreign emissaries, and possibly spies, have
not for years been collaborating with American
advocates of disarmament. It should be inquired
whether or not the Washington lobby that has
been operating against governmental appropriations
for the Army and Navy, has not received
foreign support. If these things have not been
done by representatives of foreign countries, with
such a wide-open opportunity, then the diplomats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and strategists of foreign nations ought to be sent
to a kindergarten for instruction. Could anything
be more likely than that foreign Powers should
possess the sagacity to grasp such an opportunity
to weaken our defenses?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE GOOD AND EVIL OF PEACE
AND OF WAR</h3>

<blockquote><p>"All states are in perpetual war with all. For that which we
call peace is no more than merely a name, whilst in reality Nature
has set all communities in an unproclaimed but everlasting war
against each other."</p>

<p>
<i>Plato.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>


<p>So much has been said based on ignorance and
false premise about the good and evil of
war, and the good and evil of peace, that a
few cold, relevant facts will not be out of place
here.</p>

<p>In stating these facts, the writer is standing
neither as sponsor for war nor as sponsor for
peace. He is not posing as a judge qualified to
pass sentence on peace or on war, but merely as
one who understands the subject sufficiently to
throw some new light upon it. In bearing witness
to the cruelty and mercilessness of Nature, the
writer assumes no responsibility for what Nature
has done; he was not consulted. In bearing witness
to the evils and benefits of war, and the evils
and benefits of peace, the writer does not thereby
either palliate the evils, or stand responsible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
them; neither does he assume credit for their
benefits and blessings. He realizes, however, that
the bearer of bad tidings is associated with the ill-feeling
they inspire, although he may be wholly
innocent of the ill.</p>

<p>While too much stress cannot be laid upon the
horrors of war and the individual suffering incurred
thereby, still it is not just to lay to the
account of war or militarism every ill that flesh is
heir to, as is done by many of the pacifi-maniacs.
As a matter of fact, it would be as justifiable to
attack peace because of the evils that develop in
times of peace. We do not, however, on that account
conceive peace to be a misfortune, but a
blessing.</p>

<p>While our pacifists promote war by their teachings,
they declaim against war and picture its
horrors and calamitous results. One would naturally
suppose that, appreciating what a terrible
thing war is, they would take the most scientific
and dependable means of safeguarding this country
against such a calamity; but, as a matter of
fact, they are doing everything in their power to
abolish the one means that can safeguard us
against war. With consistent inconsistency, they
place the blame for war on the advocates of adequate
armaments&mdash;the true peace-advocates and
peace-makers and enemies of war, who are forefending
us against war. The advocacy of armaments
is construed by them as the advocacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
war; measures for peace are confounded with
measures for breaching the peace.</p>

<p>A curious phase of the matter is that many
friends of armaments themselves make a similar
mistake, and think that in defending armaments
they are called upon to defend war also. As a
matter of fact, war has no defense, except as a
last resort. But when there is no other way, and
when the maintenance of peace would be a greater
calamity than war, then war is to be recommended
as the lesser evil. It is, nevertheless, undeniably
an evil, though a necessary one, just as a surgical
operation is a necessary evil&mdash;but one which, if
successful, results in such good as far to outweigh
the evil.</p>

<p>The peace sophists tell us that there has never
been a good war or a bad peace; that always in
war the best specimens of manhood have been
slain, leaving the weak and unfit for breeding purposes.
They tell us that the Napoleonic wars lowered
the stature of the entire French nation by
two inches. They tell us also that during all past
ages war for plunder has been the principal business
of mankind.</p>

<p>The following arraignment of war by General
Hiram M. Chittenden is a very fair sample of this
method of reasoning:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Both in its restriction upon marriage and in
its destruction of life war thus destroys the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
precious seed and leaves the inferior from which
to propagate. In proportion as wars are long continued,
and draw heavily upon the population,
these deleterious effects are apparent. The campaigns
of Napoleon were a mighty drain upon the
vigor of the French people. It has been held that
the average stature of the French was thereby
diminished by more than an inch. How much
their intellectual and moral stature was shrunken
by that debauchery of crime, who can say? The
decadence of the Roman people was due more to
the waste of its best blood in war than to the
causes commonly accepted. War reverses the
process of natural selection and, instead of producing
the survival of the fittest, produces the
survival of the most unfit.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>According to statistics of the pacifists, from the
year 1496 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to the year 1861 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&mdash;a period of
3,357 years&mdash;there were 227 years of peace and
3,130 years of war&mdash;thirteen years of war for
every year of peace. Now, if what we are told
about the degenerative effects of war is true, since
we know that war has been prevalent in all ages,
the natural conclusion is, what a lot of rapscallions
we must be! If war, instead of tending to
secure the survival of the fit, secures the survival
of the unfit, then after a thousand centuries of
strife we must be signally unfit.</p>

<p>The trouble with such statistics is that, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of leading us toward the truth, they lead us into
error. It may be perfectly true that for every
year of general peace there have been thirteen
years when there was a war somewhere on the
earth; but this does not imply in the least that
peace was not more general than was war, even
during those thirteen years when there was a
war. We must remember that the history of nations
does not tell us much about the affairs of
the people in times of peace; it is their wars that
have made history.</p>

<p>As we look back through time at the large number
of wars, we clump them together in perspective.
We place the wars, as it were, all on
the map at once, instead of placing them years
and centuries apart.</p>

<p>Just as there is always in human life more joy
than sorrow, more pleasure than pain, more good
than ill; so, in the history of the world, there
has been more of peace and prosperity than there
has been of war and calamity.</p>

<p>John Ruskin possessed the rare ability to perceive
truth that pointed one way, while his feelings
pointed in the opposite direction. Although
he had an emotional nature and a highly artistic
temperament, he was still a man of so broad views,
with so comprehensive a mind at the other end of
the optic nerve, that he could ratiocinate in spite
of his emotions. The following is what he had
to say on war:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>All the pure and noble arts of peace are
founded on war; no great art ever rose on earth
but among a nation of soldiers. There is no great
art possible to a nation but that which is based on
battle. When I tell you that war is the foundation
of all the arts, I mean also that it is the foundation
of all the high virtues and faculties of men.
It was very strange for me to discover this, and
very dreadful, but I saw it to be quite an undeniable
fact. The common notion that peace and the
virtues of civil life flourished together I found to
be utterly untenable. Peace and the vices of civil
life only flourish together. We talk of peace and
learning, of peace and plenty, of peace and civilization;
but I found that these are not the words that
the Muse of History coupled together: that on her
lips the words were peace and sensuality, peace
and selfishness, peace and death. I found in brief
that all great nations learned their truth of word
and strength of thought in war; that they were
nourished in war and wasted in peace; taught by
war and deceived by peace; trained by war and betrayed
by peace; in a word, that they were born in
war and expired in peace.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>We must not conclude, from the above quotation
from Ruskin, that he was an advocate of
brutality versus humanity, for he was not. The
thought he meant to convey was simply this&mdash;that
only a supreme trial, a supreme responsibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
where country, life itself, and that which is dearer
than life&mdash;home&mdash;are staked on the issue, can
bring out the highest virtues. The struggle for inalienable
human rights, whose observance is freedom,
has been the greatest influence to stimulate
the genius and the virtues of men, and these things
have been accomplished, and could only have been
accomplished, by war.</p>

<p>The humanity of Ruskin is well brought out in
the following quotation:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"... <i>Depend upon it, all work must be done at
last, not in a disorderly, scrambling, doggish way,
but in an ordered, soldierly, human way&mdash;a lawful
or 'loyal' way. Men are enlisted for the labor
that kills&mdash;the labor of war: they are counted,
trained, fed, dressed, and praised for that. Teach
the plough exercise as carefully as you do the
sword exercise, and let the officers of troops of life
be held as much gentlemen as the officers of
troops of death; and all is done: but neither this,
nor any other right thing, can be accomplished&mdash;you
can't even see your way to it&mdash;unless, first of
all, both servant and master are resolved that,
come what will of it, they will do each other justice.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson held the same opinion
about war as that held by John Ruskin. He
quoted and approved the old Greek, Heraclitus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
who said, "War is the father of all things." After
quoting this expression, Emerson said, "We of
this day can repeat it as a political and social
truth." Also, he said, "War passes the power of
all chemical solvents, breaking up the old cohesions,
and allowing the atoms of society to take
a new order."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, social order, in time of
peace, like a cultivated field, settles and solidifies,
and it must be broken down into subsoil, to support
a new and vigorous growth. The breaking by
plough and dynamite, uprooting and submerging
all undesirable growth, is rewarded by healthy and
vigorous crops of a desirable growth.</p>

<p>The very privations that have to be endured by
large numbers of persons during a great war,
stimulate economy, invention, and extraordinary
endeavor, and serve to teach many useful lessons
and to impart valuable experiential knowledge,
which is applied both during the war, and, with
greater advantage, when the war is over. When a
country is at war, all its industries are not rendered
stagnant or idle, but many of them are
stimulated to extraordinary effort when cut off
from import by blockade.</p>

<p>The legend about the stature of the French nation
being lowered two inches as a result of killing
off so many of the best men of France during
the Napoleonic wars, is a very plausible one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and one that has been made great use of by the
pacifists. But no one has thought to inquire
whether or not, during the past century, the average
stature of the Spaniards and the Italians also
has been lowered. Perhaps, if we should inquire,
we might learn that the color of the hair and eyes
and skin of the French had somewhat darkened
during that period. We might learn the truth
that the effect upon the stature and the color of
the eyes and skin and hair was mainly due to another
kind of warfare&mdash;that of the southern blood
of the Latin against the blood of the blond Norseman.
We might learn that in Italy, Spain, and
France, the posterity of the Norse giants, who
long ago overran and conquered those countries,
did not thrive well there, but slowly died down.
We might learn that in those lands the blood of
the blond is gradually overcome by the blood of
the brunette; and that, as the blond races are
larger in stature, the stature of the mixed Latin
races is lowered in proportion to the disappearance
of the blond type. The ancient Roman was
much shorter in stature than even the present
Italian or Frenchman.</p>

<p>Warfare has always subjected the weak, the
puny, the poor, the ill, the indigent, and the incompetent
to privations, trials, and strains of such
severity that they have died in large numbers.
They have not been so able as normal persons to
escape the sword and to resist famine and disease;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
consequently, fewer of them have survived than
of the more fit.</p>

<p>It is, however, argued by the peace sophists,
that in modern warfare only the most able-bodied
men are selected for military duty, and also that
the weak and unfit who remain at home are not
subjected to the same exterminating influences as
formerly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, comparing the results of
war today with those in former years, we find
the percentage of deaths among the incompetent
stay-at-homes far larger than among the soldiers
at the front.</p>

<p>It is true that medical science secures the survival
of a much larger percentage of stay-at-home
incompetents than in former years, but medical
science saves also a much larger proportion of
those injured in battle than formerly, so that the
ratio of survival between the fit and the incompetent
is today in favor of the fit. The conditions
that tend to secure the survival of the fittest are
even more effective today than they were in old-time
wars.</p>

<p>The unpleasant truth should be realized that invading
armies must, with other luxuries, have
women. As a result, they leave a large progeny&mdash;wrens
in the nests of the doves of peace. Hence,
inasmuch as soldiers are the pick of the manhood
of their country, they are likely to do about as
much toward securing the survival of the fit in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
enemy's country as they would have in their own
country.</p>

<p>There is another very important consideration,
which is that war is a great mixer of races, and
that usually mixed types benefit enormously from
their compound blood.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the mingling of races and peoples
has in all times served greatly to spread knowledge
of one another, and they have always profited
largely from the mingled knowledge. Soldiers
visiting distant lands have brought home acquaintance
with new arts and sciences and broader ideas
of international usefulness. The soldiers of the
North, who marched with Sherman through
Georgia to the sea, returned years afterward and
built cotton mills, iron foundries, and machine-shops
all over the South, and stimulated the South
with Northern energy and Northern capital.</p>

<p>We know that the inhabitants of the earth are
constantly growing more fit; consequently, we
know that they cannot be growing constantly more
unfit, due to the degenerative influence of war.
The history of nations is a history of wars; consequently
we know as untrue the contention of the
peace sophists that war secures the survival of
the unfit. We know that exactly the opposite must
be true; that war secures the survival of the
fit.</p>

<p>There is yet another thing of which the peace
sophists have never thought, and could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
expected to think&mdash;the tremendous self-saving
potentiality of the race.</p>

<p>As I have pointed out elsewhere, Nature seems
to care little for individuals, but everything for
a race or species; consequently, Nature has forefended
herself by very ample measures to insure
the survival of the fit.</p>

<p>If every able-bodied man in the world today
were to be slain, and only the weak and puny left,
although the injury would be incalculable and
would make the whole race stagger, still the next
generation of men would be almost as able-bodied
and as fit as the present generation. Let us see
why: It is because of that great potentiality&mdash;atavism.
Children inherit not only directly from
their parents, but their inheritance harks back to
grandfather, great-grandfather, and even to remote
ancestry.</p>

<p>Just as a stream of water burdened with impurities
is self-purifying when it suns itself on the
bright pebbles and on grass and moss that web and
tangle it, so life is self-purifying and self-regenerative.
Nature is constantly reaching higher and
higher. The acquired characteristics of parents
tend to become instinctive in their children. Instinct
is largely inherited experience.</p>

<p>Nature strives to protect herself against degeneracy.
Though bad conduct on the part of parents
harmfully affects the child, yet such influences are
less potent than those that are regenerative. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
this were not true, Nature's ends would not be so
well secured.</p>

<p>There is in all animal organisms a certain innate
power of resistance to germs of disease, and there
is likewise in man a similar power of resistance
to degeneracy.</p>

<p>The forces that operate to protect the individual
operate also to shield the species by affording protection
against evil inheritance.</p>

<p>Abnormal types are not always representative
of diseased or degenerate conditions; other considerations
must be weighed. Even some criminals
may be atavic examples of a class of individuals
who were better suited to live under the
savage conditions that existed many generations
ago.</p>

<p>Nature has resources for her protection far beyond
our ken. Some of them have, by our inquiry,
been discovered. We have discovered that not
only do we immunize ourselves to withstand repeated
attacks from the same disease, but also our
children to some extent inherit that immunity.</p>

<p>When syphilis, the most abominable disease that
ever afflicted mankind, was brought to Europe by
the sailors of Columbus, the Europeans, possessing
no immunity against it, died by hundreds of
thousands. It afflicted equally all classes, from
peasant to king. This disease among the West Indian
tribes was slow-moving, and comparatively
mild; but it became exceedingly virulent, rapid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and almost always fatal, in the blood of the unimmunized
people of the Old World. This disease
alone has been more harmful to the human
race than all the wars of the world since the dawn
of human history.</p>

<p>Although today the Old-World races have acquired
considerable immunity to that affliction and
although science has discovered a rational and
comparatively successful treatment, it is still the
greatest single degenerative influence with which
the race has to contend. Its evil potency is greatly
enhanced by the facility with which it weds alcoholism,
and breeds tuberculosis, cancer, and
paranoia.</p>

<p>The old pioneers sowed the western continent
and the islands of the sea with the germs of smallpox
and measles. Smallpox, terrible anywhere,
was tenfold more so with the newly discovered
peoples. Measles was more fatal with the Indians
than smallpox with the Europeans. Only recently,
in Alaska, whole communities have been
wiped out by the measles. Even chicken-pox,
harmless with us, was nearly always fatal to the
inhabitants of the Pacific Islands.</p>

<p>The races, however, gradually but surely,
developed immunity, and the great world-scourges
are now largely robbed of their terrors. Similarly
has mankind developed powers of recuperation
that largely tend to immunization against such degenerative
effects as are of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>When a large limb is lopped from a tree, the
mother-stem puts out a new shoot, and grows another
strong limb in its place; similarly, when
limbs are lopped from the human family tree, new
limbs are stimulated to growth. This peculiarity
of living things is strangely manifested in certain
species, particularly among the lower orders of
animals. Certain animals have no way of seeking
self-preservation except by breeding in such large
numbers as to supply the appetites of all enemies,
and glut the demand. A big salmon sometimes
lays a gallon of small eggs, often numbering as
high as 27,000,000. Certain species of polyp are
provided no means whatever, either by speed or
powers of resistance, to defend themselves, but
they breed so rapidly that they cannot all be
eaten.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Now that we have defended war against the
charge of securing the survival of the unfit, and
have proved that, on the contrary, war has, during
all the ages, been instrumental in securing
the survival of the fit, let us, without presuming
against peace, see whether or not peace has a
blameless record.</p>

<p>The long periods of peace during the past century
have allowed the peoples time and opportunity
to acquire wealth and luxury, and to develop
peculiar tastes, especially along emotional
lines.... Modern fiction is a universal love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
story. Art is largely a portrayal of sentimentality.</p>

<p>In olden times, when human suffering in every
guise, born of war, was very common, the appeals
of the poor, the weak, and the infirm were not
much heeded, for there were ever present such
severe and exacting concerns as to command the
attention and to absorb the resources of the
people.</p>

<p>In time of peace less rigid economy is practised
than in time of war. Dangers and hardships,
which are the concomitants of war, have been
found in all ages better formative influences for
making hardy, successful men than a life of ease,
comfort, and luxury. Consequently, in time of
peace there is a far more preponderant tendency
toward degeneracy and national decay than there
is in time of war, in spite of the large numbers
of fine specimens of manhood that are killed in
war.</p>

<p>When Cyrus the Great, with his hardy mountaineers,
had conquered the peace-loving, comfort-loving
people of the lowlands, he told his soldiers
that they must not make their homes in the lowlands,
but must return to their mountain fastnesses,
because if they settled to a life of ease and
luxury, they would become unwarlike, effeminate,
and degenerate, like the lowlanders they had conquered
and enslaved, and later would themselves
be conquered and enslaved by other mountaineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
inured to privations and hardships, who would
descend upon them.</p>

<p>Witness the wisdom of Herodotus, who said:</p>

<p>"<i>It is the settled appointment of Nature that
soft soils should breed soft men, and that the same
land should never be famous for the excellence of
its fruit and for the vigor of its inhabitants.</i>"</p>

<p>Montesquieu said:</p>

<p>"<i>The barrenness of the soil makes men industrious,
sober, hard-working, courageous, and warlike,
for they must obtain by their own exertion
that which the earth denies them, whilst the fertility
of a country produces in them love of ease,
indolence, and a sense of cautious self-preservation.</i>"</p>

<p>The ancient Spartans in time of peace voluntarily
subjected themselves to every privation and
hardship necessary to keep them in prime condition
for instant war.</p>

<p>Nature is never moved by pity. Nature is not a
sentimentalist. The earthquake shock is no respecter
of persons. When a ship founders, the
angry waves of the sea show no mercy to the
drowning, and have no pity for those struggling
to survive in the life-boats. The arctic airs of
winter are as savage to those exposed to them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
are the teeth of wolves. All animal life on the
earth must constantly contend with both the devouring
elements of Nature and the devouring
greed of other animal life.</p>

<p>Pity is a child of the imagination, and is, for
that reason, a peculiarly human attribute. It
is a very noble trait, and is of material aid in
greatening mutual human usefulness. Nevertheless,
no one thinks for a moment of blaming any
of the lower animals for their appetites and passions;
they are understood to be normal and necessary.
Similarly, all our normal appetites and
passions are necessary. Considered in the broad,
as natural attributes, there are no such things as
bad normal emotions and passions; it is only when
they become perverted by degeneracy or abuse
that they are evil.</p>

<p>The passion of pity may be perverted and
abused just as the sex appetite or the appetite
for food and drink.</p>

<p>If human pity had dominated the council at the
creation of the world, the result would have been
infinite injury, because none of the higher orders
of animals, even man himself, could have been
developed. In short, there would have been no intelligent
beings on earth.</p>

<p>During periods of peace, a large number of persons,
moved by pity for the indigent, the halt, the
lame, the blind, extend to them the alleviating hand
of charity. Philanthropy finds favor in the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
eye, and charity becomes a cheap and easy means
of courting public opinion. The philanthropist
with means for gratifying his passion of pity, or
the ambitious aspirant for public favor with cash
to invest in public opinion, finds himself soon surrounded
with a multitude of itchy-palmy hands to
help him spend his money to buy what he is after,
and at the same time obtain profit for themselves.
Consequently, objects of charity become opportunities
to be prized and made the most of.
Charity organizations are supported both by well-meaning
sympathetic persons and by publicity-purchasing
persons and their press-agents.</p>

<p>Many an ambitious politician or social climber
finds it profitable to become a patron of some supposedly
deserving charity. Recently, some one
inquired into the methods of a New York charity
organization, and found that the sum paid in
salaries to the various officers of the society was
more than twice the amount actually expended
in charity. But those who donated the money
got what they paid for; the hangers-on of the
society got what they wanted, and thereby lessened
the actual harm that the money would have
done had it all reached its supposed objects.</p>

<p>While a limited amount of well-directed charitable
effort may be for the general good, still by
far the larger part of promiscuous charity does
harm. Broadly speaking, charity of all kinds is
wrong in principle, because the misfortunes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the unfit are a part of natural processes for their
elimination, and anything done by charity to defeat
the decrees of Nature is wrong.</p>

<p>These are some of the responsibilities for which
we friends of peace must stand, if we succeed in
preventing war by preparedness against war.</p>

<p>Those who are advocating the abolition of
armaments, and are thereby fostering war, have
not this responsibility; for, if they are successful
in what they are teaching and doing, the pretty
constant warfare that will prevail among the
great nations during the next century will cure
much of the hypersentimentalism that finds expression
in large degenerative charities; and these
charities will be swept away under the tread of
marching armies. Whereas, if we succeed, by our
advocacy, in securing adequate armaments, and
thereby maintain enduring peace, then nothing
can prevent our great promiscuous charities from
continuing to secure the survival of the unfit with
the continuous pollution of the blood-stream of
the race from their degenerate blood through intermarriage
with normal persons.</p>

<p>The arrestation of the self-purifying processes
of Nature which are intended to clarify the blood
of the race, by breeding the unfit and turning them
back upon the race, is like turning the sewage of
a city into its water supply.</p>

<p>If all incompetents&mdash;the hopelessly diseased and
degenerate&mdash;were to be exterminated, it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a very good thing for the race. Such methods
have actually been practised in the past. At one
time, when ancient Babylon was besieged, all the
aged and diseased were murdered; and in ancient
Greece, deformed or diseased children were
killed at birth. But the trouble with this method
is that no men possessing the human qualities
rendering them worthy of survival could be found
among us to do the wholesale executions. The
mere possession of the inhuman qualities necessary
to carry out the wholesale slaughter would
elect the executioners themselves for slaughter.
Man cannot be pitiless, like Nature, without himself
becoming unworthy of pity, and, consequently,
unworthy of survival.</p>

<p>Human survival must be co-operative. Human
reproduction depends somewhat on lovability.
According to the law of natural selection, a lovable
person is selected rather than an unlovable
person. Neither sex is so apt to fall in love and
mate with a person of the other sex who is pitiless,
as with one possessing pity and sympathy. Pity
and sympathy, just like the love of parenthood,
are bonds of the family. A community&mdash;a nation&mdash;is
only a larger family.</p>

<p>Charity and sympathy make men gregarious.
A world without charity or sympathy would be
most unattractive. Human companionship in its
higher values would not exist.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when charity and sympathy build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and support large almshouses, until, as in London,
one-third of all the property tax goes to the
poor fund, then charity becomes an institution
for breeding paupers and imbeciles. Such charity
is the misuse of a virtue. Nine-tenths of all
the paupers of one generation in England are
children of the paupers of a preceding generation.</p>

<p>The following is what an eminent Englishman
has to say of the condition of things in his
country:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>We have a standing army of 1,200,000 paupers,
and our permanent and occasional paupers number
together at least 3,000,000. Our paupers are
maintained at a yearly cost of about £30,000,000
to the community, and were it not for the Draconic
administration of our poor-laws all our work-houses
would be overcrowded by workers who
would gladly exchange freedom and starvation
wages for the confinement of the workhouse. No
other nation has an army of paupers similar to
that of Great Britain."&mdash;J. Ellis Barker,</i> in
"<i>Great and Greater Britain.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />


<p><span class="smcap">A Cat Story</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an excellent Queen
who ruled over a beautiful and fruitful island.
The island was not large; it had an area of only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
a few square miles, and the inhabitants numbered
but a thousand. They lived mainly by fishing
and agriculture.</p>

<p>The Queen loved both her people and her cats.
As she would not allow a kitten killed, cats
soon overran the palace. Some of these cats,
dominated by the mousing instinct, took up their
habitation in the fields and woods; for mice, small
birds, squirrels, and all manner of cat-game were
plentiful on the island.</p>

<p>The cats continued to multiply, until they became
a great pest to the farmers, killing their
chickens, ducklings, and song-birds. Then the
good Queen divided the island between her people
and her cats. She gave a tenth of the island to
the cats. A fence was built between the cats and
the people.</p>

<p>The cats soon multiplied to the number of
20,000, but there was not forage enough to feed
them through the next winter; consequently, half
of them died during the cold weather. In the autumn
of the following year there were again
20,000 cats on the island, half of which were
doomed to die by starvation during the winter;
but the kind-hearted Queen taxed the people for
food sufficient to feed the cats, and to save as
many lives as possible.</p>

<p>The succeeding summer being long and fruitful,
the cats thrived well, and the next autumn
there were 50,000 cats on the island, and as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
was but forage enough to winter 10,000 cats,
40,000 must starve during the coming winter, unless
fed. Again the Queen taxed her people, and
the cats were saved; but, to the amazement of the
Queen and her little people, the next autumn
brought 100,000 hungry cats to be fed, and it had
come to a point where either the people or the
cats must starve.</p>

<p>With grief, the Queen decided in favor of the
people, for it was evident that, if the people were
allowed to starve to save the cats, the cats also
would starve without the people. That year,
90,000 cats starved to death on the island.</p>

<p>Thus, the good Queen's well-meant charity, intended
to save 10,000 cats from starving to death,
finally resulted in 90,000 cats starving to death.
Actually, her attempt to lessen cat misery multiplied
that misery nine-fold.</p>

<p>Now, what was true of those cats applies with
exactly equal truth to the rearing of paupers and
incompetents in times of peace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In all the countries of the civilized world today,
there are institutions for rearing and educating
idiots. Sometimes, a section of an idiot's
skull is cut out, and the skull trepanned in order
to give his little brain room to expand. In
this way, an idiot, incapable of feeding himself,
may develop intelligence enough to vote, under
the instruction of the ward-heeler, or he may even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
develop into a public expounder of the beauties
of defenselessness as a safeguard against war.</p>

<p>The most common of all errors of conviction is
the belief that knowledge of right-doing necessarily
leads us to do right. But the truth is, that we
are mainly guided by sentiment, even when it is
diametrically opposed to our knowledge of right.
No branch of our learning is more strongly fortified
by facts of experience than that thoroughbred
animals cannot be bred from scrub stock; that
superior types of dogs cannot be bred from mongrels;
that a fast trotting-horse is never sired by
a Mexican burro or foaled by a heavy draughtmare.</p>

<p>We know absolutely that identically the same
laws govern the breeding both of human beings
and of the lower animals, and that exactly according
to the seed sown will the fruit be. If sentiment
leads us to sow tares among the wheat, we inevitably
injure the wheat. No breeder of the
lower animals would, from sentimental considerations,
employ inferior types for his purposes.</p>

<p>With human growth, just as with the growth of
vegetation in forest and field, there is only a certain
limited amount of room in the sun, and a certain
limited amount of nourishment and moisture
in the soil. When charity aids an inferior type
to secure a plot of earth and a plot of sky, it can
do so only at the expense of some better type,
which would otherwise have conquered the spaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
for itself, had not the inferior specimen had
charity as an ally.</p>

<p>Apropos of this philosophy, I quote the following
from an article in <i>Science</i> by G. H. Parker,
Professor of Zoölogy, of Harvard:&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Thus asylums, retreats, hospitals, and so forth,
have been established by private munificence or
public grants. More or less under the protection
of these institutions has grown up a body of
semi-dependents and defectives whose increase it
is that excites the apprehension of the eugenists.
That in the past such individuals have always
formed a part of our race cannot be doubted,
but that they ever showed a tendency to increase
comparable with what seems to be occurring at
present is highly improbable. The occasion of
this increase is not, in my opinion, merely the
exigencies of modern civilization; it is at least in
part due to the immense spread of humanitarian
activities which have characterized the last century
of our civilization.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>If Andrew Carnegie were to give $100,000,000
for the support of paupers in the United States
and Great Britain, and another $100,000,000 for
the saving and kindly treatment and support of
imbeciles and incompetents, more continuous
harm to the race would result, by securing the
survival of the unfit, than would result from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
a perpetual war between any two of the
nations now engaged in the great European
conflict.</p>

<p>As all charities thrive like a green bay tree in
times of peace, and are neglected in times of war,
it will be seen that charity alone in times of peace
is more potent in securing the survival of the
unfit than war could possibly be.</p>

<p>About here, the reader may conclude that I am
just as inconsistent in advocating armaments to
preserve peace, which, I hold, tends to foster degeneracy
and decay, as are the pacifists who, by
advocating disarmament, promote war, which,
they hold, is most potential in fostering the same
thing.</p>

<p>But this is not so striking an inconsistency as
may first appear, because, as I have shown, nation-wide
military training, such as that practised in
Switzerland, would make for regeneracy and efficiency
far more than all our charities, vices, and
profligacy make for degeneracy and decay. No
branch of education&mdash;not even all the prevalent
preachments on the subjects of hygiene, moral reform,
cleanliness, temperance, and right living&mdash;would
be so influential for betterment as would the
introduction of the Swiss system of military training.</p>

<p>In order to be a good soldier, a man must be
fit, just as a college athlete must be fit; and military
training, like the training of the college ath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>lete,
compels him to observe the hygienic laws of
right living.</p>

<p>We grow upon what we do and what we eat. If
we live on an unbalanced food, which supplies too
much of one kind of nourishment and too little of
another, we become unbalanced in body and mind.
Similarly, if our occupation exercises some of our
organs and faculties too much and others not
enough, we become unbalanced in body and
mind.</p>

<p>The saying is trite that a sound mind requires
a sound body. Likewise, a balanced mind must
have a balanced body.</p>

<p>The occupations of civil life, if not constantly
accompanied by systematic, scientific mental and
physical training throw us out of balance. The
success of Muldoon's famous human repair-shop
depends entirely upon building up by proper food
and strenuous exercise long-neglected organs and
faculties.</p>

<p>The lower branches of a tree, which do not receive
the necessary exercise from the wind, and
the necessary vitalizing stimulus of the sun, gradually
atrophy, and wither, die, and drop off; likewise
do unused and unstimulated organs and
faculties of the body shrink toward atrophy and
pale toward death. The only part of a tree that is
alive is where the sap runs. All the rest of the
tree is dead. Organs and faculties of the human
body not adequately exercised to circulate through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
them the required amount of sap, gradually begin
to die.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener is the Muldoon of the new English
army. The raw recruits are trained for their
coming fight in much the same manner that a
pugilist is trained. They are made to take the
long walk out and the sharp run home, carrying
weights; they wrestle and spar; perform all manner
of calisthenics and gymnastics; are fed proper
food, and are made properly to bathe. To the
great majority of them, this man-making training
is a revelation, but they find themselves so improved
in health and so strengthened in body and
mind that, when they return to civil life, they
will still utilize much of the useful knowledge of
how to get fit and keep fit; and just as the hard
work imposed upon the soldiers is made easier by
their military training, so, when they return to
civil life, they will find all their tasks much easier
of accomplishment.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from a letter just received
by me from a prominent English clergyman:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>The war is making the Britisher a new man,
and he is blissfully unconscious of the conversion
in himself. Every class is feeling the uplift. He
will be stronger in his religion, his politics, and
his commerce. Half the men in Kitchener's Army
hate fighting and taking life. They have enlisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
for conscience' sake. Naturally they will make
the finest soldiers.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Soldierly fitness includes not only those sterling
qualities of higher manhood&mdash;cleanliness, temperance,
efficiency, and moral stamina, raised from
a semi-subconscious latency into conscious action
by a military training&mdash;but also it includes that
very important attribute&mdash;devotion. A military
training develops a vague sense of patriotism
whose height is a hurrah for country, to that
height of devotion where one will gladly die for
his country.</p>

<p>In South America, there is a very potential
little republic where military training produces
just such beneficial results in a very high degree.
Chili, perhaps, comes nearer to Germany in economic
efficiency than any other country in the
world.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more absurd than the fear of
the American people that a good-sized standing
army of trained soldiers would menace their liberty.
The very preparation, by education and
training, necessary to make a good soldier, being
the very best training in the world to make him a
good citizen, would constitute one of the strongest
fortifications possible to defend us against ourselves.
It would act as a gyroscopic stabilizer
for our democratic institutions, and an equilibrator
for our vacillating hot-air ship of state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the very best books that I have yet seen
upon the subject of peace and war is "Peace Insurance,"
by Richard Stockton, Jr., published in
January, 1915, by A. C. McClurg and Company.
It is a book that cannot fail at this time to do a
large amount of good, and I heartily recommend
it to the reader. I quote the following from its
pages:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>To avoid exaggeration we shall quote first
Mr. Kirkpatrick, who attempts to show the
horrors of war in his book, 'War&mdash;What For?' by
extracts from the New York Independent of
March 14, 1907</i>:</p>

<p>"'<i>It is the common consensus of opinion among
investigators that industrial casualties in this nation
number more than 500,000 yearly. Dr. Josiah
Strong estimates the number at 564,000. As there
are 525,600 minutes in a year, it may readily be
seen that every minute (day and night) our industrial
system sends to the graveyard or to the
hospital a human being, the victim of some accident
inseparable from his toil. We cry out
against the horrors of war.... But the ravages
... of industrial warfare are far greater than
those of armed conflict. The number of killed
or mortally wounded (including deaths from accidents,
suicides, and murders, but excluding deaths
from disease) in the Philippine War from February
4, 1899, to April 30, 1902, was 1,573. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
fatal casualties were spread over a period of three
years and three months. But one coal mine alone
in one year furnishes a mortality more than 38
per cent. in excess of this.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>The Japanese War is commonly looked upon
as the bloodiest of modern wars. According to
the official statement of the Japanese Government,
46,180 Japanese were killed, and 10,970 died of
wounds. Our industrial war shows a greater mortality
year by year.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>But we are all of us more familiar with the
Civil War, and we know what frightful devastation
it caused in households North and South. It was,
however, but a tame conflict compared with that
which rages today, and which we call peace. The
slaughter of its greatest battles are thrown in the
shade by the slaughter which particular industries
inflict today. Ask any schoolboy to name three
of the bloodiest battles of that war, and he will
probably name Gettysburg, Chancellorsville, and
Chickamauga. The loss on both sides was</i>:</p>

<p>"<i>Said Dr. Josiah Strong in the</i> North American
Review <i>for November, 1906</i>:</p>

<p>"'<i>We might carry on a half-dozen Philippine
wars for three-quarters of a century with no
larger number of total casualties than take place
yearly in our peaceful industries.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>Taking the lowest of our three estimates of
industrial accidents, the total number of casualties
suffered by our industrial army in one year is
equal to the average annual casualties of our Civil
War, plus those of the Philippine War, plus those
of the Russian-Japanese War.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>Think of carrying on three wars at the same
time, world without end.</i>'</p>

<p>"<i>Said President Roosevelt in his Annual Message
for 1907</i>:</p>

<p>"'<i>Industry in the United States now exacts
... a far heavier toll of death than all of our
wars put together.... The number of deaths in
battle in all the foreign wars put together for
the last century and a quarter, aggregate considerably
less than one year's death record for our
industries.'...</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>

<p>"<i>Glancing over these comparisons between war
and peace, we find that much of the horror of
war dwindles away. Comparing those actually
killed in industry and accident with those killed
or dying from wounds in various wars, we find
that the annual peace rate is approximately two
and a half times that of the average annual Japanese
loss, three times that of the Union loss in the
Civil War, five times the Russian loss in the
Japanese War, six times the Confederate loss in
the Civil War, twenty-eight times the English loss
in the Anglo-Boer War, and ninety times the
American loss in the Spanish War. In other
words, it would take the average annual deaths of
the English and French in the Crimea, the Americans
in the Mexican War, the North in the Civil
War, the Americans in the Spanish War, the English
in the Boer War, and the Japanese in the
Russian War to approach the annual United
States peace rate. Assuming the burden of all
these wars, at once, and without ceasing, would be
no more a drain than our peace death rate! Need
we say more as to the cost in lives, as to the sorrowing
mother, sweetheart, and wife? Think of
these things. Where now is the bestiality and
horror? Does it belong more to war where comparatively
few die for their country willingly and
nobly, or to peace where the multitudes die for
sordid gain&mdash;for dollars and cents? Would it not
be meet for the pacifists, assuming that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the best interest of the country at heart, to turn
first to the horrors of peace, and lastly to the horrors
of war?</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>It is well to observe that a very large percentage
of the injuries and deaths in the United States in
times of peace, noted by Dr. Strong, are due to
preventable causes, and one of the best remedies is
a military training. In Germany, the number of
persons per capita of population killed and injured
by accidents in time of peace is not half as
great as it is in the United States.</p>

<p>These losses are part of the high price that this
country pays for inefficiency. They could be very
largely remedied by military training, which
quickens awareness and alertness. Many an accident
resulting in severe wounding or death is due
to undeveloped and untrained powers of mind, and
to lack of physical co-ordination. In the works
of the National Cash Register Company, at Dayton,
Ohio, where all employees are given the
equivalent of military training in care and efficiency,
personal injury through accidents is almost
entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>A man who has been taught to play football and
to box and wrestle in his youth is not nearly so
likely in after years to fall and injure himself,
or to be hit by a trolley car, or automobile, as
one who has not had that training. Similarly, a
man who, in his youth, has had his mind developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to quick alertness, and every muscle of his body
brought under the domination of the will by military
training, is far less likely to be injured by
accident than one who has not had a military
training. Consequently, many of the ills of peace
may be cured by the practice of the very medicine
that is the best remedy for war.</p>

<p>William James, in an article entitled, "The
Moral Equivalent of War," starts out with the
remark, "The war against war is going to be no
holiday excursion or camping party." He adds
that, "There is something highly paradoxical in
the modern man's relation to war."</p>

<p>He continues:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>"<i>Ask all our millions north and south whether
they would vote now to have our war for the
Union expunged from history, and the record
of a peaceful transition to the present time substituted
for that of its marches and battles, and,
probably hardly a handful of eccentrics would say
yes.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Yet ask those same people whether they would
be willing in cold blood to stand another civil war
now to gain another similar possession, and not one
man or woman would vote for the proposition.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Let us suppose that the same Southern states
that then seceded were to secede again today,
capture all the negroes there and all men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
women whose skins are tinted by negro blood,
enslave them, and establish anew the auction
block at the slave market: then let us ask the
people of the North Mr. James's second question.</p>

<p>What defense has the average person against
being convinced by such sophistry, coming from
so eminent a psychologist and philosopher as
William James? The conclusion of the average
person is: "A great man like him must know
better than I, he having made a study of such
things." This article was given wide circulation
by the Association for International Conciliation.
It was also published in <i>McClure's Magazine</i>, and
again in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>Others have said, and are saying, similar silly
things about the war against war, but they are
not men of such intellectual eminence as was
William James. It is true that Dr. David Starr
Jordan is a very prominent person, and says
things even sillier than anything that William
James said, but exactly there is the saving grace
of his sayings. Some of his conclusions are so
utterly irrational and absurd as to enable a very
large number of persons to perceive their falsity,
whereas the error is not so easily perceived in
such statements as the foregoing quoted from Mr.
James.</p>

<p>Let us examine the proposition to make war
on war. The only common-sense way to wage
war on war is to war against the evils that pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>duce
war. To wage war on war, which comes like
the visitation of a physician, to cure ills, would
be like waging war on the medical profession to
cure a decimating pestilence. To arrest the hand
of the surgeon in order to save bloodshed is to let
the patient die of cancer.</p>

<p>Our Civil War was merely a great surgical
operation which removed a malignant cancer
from the breast of Columbia. Mars, the old and
experienced surgeon, made a good job of it. Columbia's
ailment was one that could not be cured
by physic, poultice, incantations, or other quack
nostrums, which, Mr. James suggested, might
have been tried. The patient had to be operated
on with the sword, so that the question as to the
right or wrong of the Civil War, and as to
whether it should have then been fought, and
whether, if it had been delayed till now, it should
now be fought, depends upon a choice of evils&mdash;depends
entirely upon whether or not American
slavery was a greater evil than the American Civil
War.</p>

<p>Two of my brothers were killed in the awful
struggle to free the slaves and save the Union.
It was worth the price to them, to me, and to the
rest of my family; and I am of the opinion that
every other family in the country who made a
like sacrifice would agree with me that to free
four millions of human beings from bondage was
worth the price. Emancipation then not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
freed four millions, but it saved, between that
time and now, more than twenty millions from
the yoke and the lash. But, what is still more
important, the emancipation of the slaves emancipated
their masters also&mdash;emancipated all of us,
North and South&mdash;and raised the proclamation
of human equality by our country's fathers from
a mockery and a shame to a reality.</p>

<p>If there were men and women and children
bought and sold in this country today, you and I,
reader, would mix up in the infamous business
with gun and sword, and we would not wait long
to do much voting about it, either. "Great national
problems," said Bismarck, "are solved
not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but
by blood and iron."</p>

<p>It is very evident that it would have been
wrong in 1860 for some powerful external force,
waging war against war, to have prevented the
Civil War, and thereby have prevented the emancipation
of the slaves.</p>

<p>It is all very well at this time to prate about
the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the
differences between the North and South before
the Civil War broke out. That is exactly what
was tried. Even after the war broke out, Lincoln,
one of the greatest men that America ever
produced, tried with all his might to do that very
thing. War was the only way.</p>

<p>A very large percentage of the wars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
world have been waged for freedom&mdash;have been
wars for justice, and against tyranny. To war
against such wars would be to war for tyranny,
and against freedom and justice. Actually, those
who today are recruiting for the war against
war are asking you to enlist in a campaign to
shackle the hands of the oppressed in future
years, and tie them down with ball and chain to
prevent them from striking for liberty. They are
to be denied the right of war for freedom, which
was our right in the Revolution.</p>

<p>Every man exerts a positive influence either
for good or for evil. If the advocates of disarmament
and non-resistance are exerting a good
influence, then I am exerting a bad influence, and
every advocate of armed defense is a worker of
evil. You, reader, must judge between us.</p>

<p>If it is wrong to insure with armaments against
invasion of this country, which invasion would
mean the violation of our homes, the rape of our
wives and daughters and sisters and sweethearts;
if it is right to invite invasion by non-resistance,
and wrong to oppose it with force; if, when an
enemy injures us, it is the correct thing to let
him add insult to the first offense; then it is
wrong to be a man, it is wrong to resent dishonor
of the home, and all of us who have any manhood
in us should be emasculated.</p>

<p>If, when this country is invaded, some militant
scoundrel, forcing his way into your home, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
lay the hand of violent lust on trembling wife or
daughter, would you observe the pacifist policy of
non-resistance, or would you kill him right there,
even if it cost you your life? I know your answer.
The invading army would be lessened by one
soldier, or there would be one less American.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<h3>WHAT SHALL THE END BE?</h3>


<p>Is it possible to prescribe a remedy for war?
We know that law, unsupported by force,
cannot be substituted for war. We know that
war will obey no law other than that of necessity,
and, consequently, that the settling of national
differences at an international court of conciliatory
arbitration is not workable. We know that
no nation will abide by the dictates of any such
court when those dictates are opposed to its interests,
unless that court has the power to enforce
its decrees.</p>

<p>We know, then, that an international court of
arbitration can dispense only such justice as may
be consistent with the interests and necessities of
the nations possessing the power to dominate that
court; therefore, we know that the greatest measure
of justice and the greatest security for peace
that may be expected are only what may be
pledged by the union of a majority of the great
nations in a pool of their national interests and
necessities, to maintain such international order
as shall be consistent with the terms of the pool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
All other nations outside of the pool will then
be compelled to observe the law of the pooling
nations, because the necessity of keeping peace
with these dominant Powers will be greater than
any other necessity.</p>

<p>The justice that the weaker nations may expect
will depend upon the degree in which their individual
interests are the mutual concern of the
larger interests.</p>

<p>Armies and navies will then become veritable
international police forces, and the necessity for
large competitive armaments will be very greatly
lessened.</p>

<p>There will then be greater security for peace,
although this striving world is not likely soon to
be a safe and quiet nesting place for the dove of
peace; because at any time, when the necessities
of the pooling nations shall put too great a strain
on the compact, then the pool will break and war
ensue. The great aim of the peoples of the nations
should not be for a Utopian peace based
on merely sentimental grounds, but for a peace
secured by so practicable an <i>entente</i> and pact between
the great Powers as shall, entirely aside
from sentiment, work for the best welfare of the
world.</p>

<p>Russian, Teuton, Frenchman, Anglo-Saxon,
when you shall have returned your blood-wet
swords to their scabbards, then join hands over-seas
with us Americans, who are kin to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
blood you have spilled, and let us take serious
counsel of one another.</p>

<p>But, Americans, though we may turn our face
toward the morning that should come, such posturing
cannot, any more than the cock's-crow,
bring the morning; and until the great international
compact be made, we shall be able to find
safety only by adequate preparation to stand
alone against the dread eventuality of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<h2>PRAISE FROM PATRIOTS</h2>

<h3>Extracts From a Few of Hundreds of Letters Praising
HUDSON MAXIM'S DEFENSELESS AMERICA</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"'Defenseless America' is a capital book. I hope it
will have the widest possible circulation throughout
our country. The prime duty for this nation is to
prepare itself so that it can protect itself; and this is
the duty that you are preaching in your admirable
volume."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar S. Straus:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"'Defenseless America', coming from an expert, will
awaken interest in the most practical method of securing
peace by safeguarding our national existence.
I am in fullest accord with your Conclusion&mdash;an international
compact with adequate international force
to maintain it, and give adequate guarantee to enforce
its decrees."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">S. S. McClure:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"A most convincing book on an extraordinarily important
subject, done in a manner not only convincing
but irrefutable."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Rear-Admiral Charles D. Sigsbee:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I should not have said that the subject could be
treated in a way to make it fascinating to the popular
reader, yet I now think that is precisely what you
have done. May the book bear good fruit!"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Garrett P. Serviss:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"'Defenseless America' ought to go into the hands
of ten million American citizens before another month
passes. You have done a magnificent thing for your
country! In God's name, may she turn from the silly
twaddle of the pacifist wiseacres, and save herself,
even on the crumbling verge!"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">George von Lengerke Meyer:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"It will go a great ways toward aiding the people of
this country to realize the necessity of a proper national
defense and a preparedness against war."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. John A. Logan:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I wish that every official in the land could read it."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Orison Swett Marden:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"A colossal, monumental treatment of the subject."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Franklin D. Roosevelt:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"You have brought the whole question of National
Defense to a basis which can be readily understood by
the average layman."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieut. Baron Hrolf von Dewitz:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"In 'Defenseless America' you explode a crater of
information on the subject such as has never been
detonated before."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Beverley W. Dunn:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I wish to congratulate you on the conspicuous and
valuable service that you have rendered the people of
the United States in writing this book."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. E. C. Beck:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart
for this masterpiece of revelation on your part, this
opus which I look upon in the nature of an historical
event. May the Lord use your book to pound a little
sense into our fellow citizens."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. J. F. Stillemans:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I am only one of thousands who would welcome an
edition as cheap as possible of 'Defenseless America'
so that we could distribute it freely."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleveland Moffett:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"'Defenseless America' is great stuff and ought to
be read by every loyal American."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">W. Sidney Jopson:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The direct results of reading 'Defenseless America'
were that I went to Plattsburg and applied for admission
in our National Guard."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<h2>PRAISE FROM EDITORS</h2>

<h3>No Serious Book Has Ever Been More Highly Praised by
the Leading Newspapers of America.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia Public Ledger:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"A book by an expert in modern armament who
writes with graphic power what he knows better than
anyone in this country&mdash;a solemn warning."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">New York American:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"No book issued on the subject marshals with equal
skill so great an array of facts as Mr. Maxim's volume.
In the present state of national thought upon our military
and naval needs this book is most valuable."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington Star:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"In origin and treatment this is a surpassing study
whose sheer information, apart from its personal conclusions,
is worth the serious attention, not only of the
legislator, but of the plain man behind the lawmaker."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Detroit Free Press:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Hudson Maxim makes a call to arms against war.
Here is an argument for proper armament from a
man who not only foretold the Japanese war and
named the victor, but also prophesied the present conflict
and by knowledge and study of world's conditions
knows what he is talking about and makes his warning
timely."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Los Angeles Times:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"A powerful book on an imminent and national
problem that every thinking citizen should read with
care."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston Transcript:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Shows how it is safer for a country like the United
States with so large a territory to defend, to prepare,
so that no foreign nation will be anxious to try a struggle
with us. The peace of the United States will then
rest on a firm foundation."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baltimore Sun:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The book is brilliantly written, with the severity of
one who intensely desires to drive a truth home and
with the assurance of one who feels his statistics unassailable
and his arguments unanswerable. He is supported
by many witnesses whose knowledge must be
respected. There is no smallness in the writer's attitude.
He appears to feel intensely his mission as
prophet and patriot."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleveland Plain Dealer:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Here is a man, frankly interested in war, who seems
utterly honest in his beliefs. The book contains an
expert elucidation of the weaknesses of the American
army and navy. It has practical suggestions for improvement.
It is, in fact, a complete text book for the
student of American preparedness or unpreparedness,
written, of course, in a sincerely ex parte manner."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Brooklyn Citizen:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The book should be read and studied carefully by
every lover of his country."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lewiston Journal:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"'Defenseless America' is a ringing and insistent
call, calculated to startle the average American out of
his peaceful and complacent sense of security."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">New York Press:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The book is interesting&mdash;as interesting as a well-written
and absorbing novel, only it deals with vital
facts that have a bearing on the lives and fortunes of
every one in this country."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Outlook:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"We wish that we could think that those who are
opposed to any preparation against war by this country
would read and consider this book of Mr. Hudson
Maxim."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Life, N. Y.:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"One of the early lumber-camp tales ended with a
stirring scene in which a big, sandy-haired hero, caught
in the path of a bursting log jam, hurls his cap defiantly
into the advancing wall of destruction, just
before it whelms him. Such a gesture, futile yet magnificent,
is suggested by Hudson Maxim's fiery appeal
to the sleeping intelligence and lulled self-interest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
his countrymen, 'Defenseless America.' The book contains
a remorseless marshaling of stern facts, fused
into prophecy by a sort of incandescent logic. It is the
first bold proclaiming of the bitter 'civilization' truths
revealed by the vast disillusionment of the war. And
these are here flung, as the author feels, into the face
of approaching national disaster."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Scientific American:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The scope of 'Defenseless America' is so all-embracing,
that the author has given a veritable mine of information
upon the subject of war and war material.
Mr. Maxim is well qualified by his long and successful
association, as a practical and successful inventor, with
the production of the implements of war, to write upon
the technical side of the question; and this he does with
a characteristic force and lucidity which will render
the subject perfectly understandable and full of fascinating
interest for the average layman."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Review of Reviews:</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"A graphic and effective presentation of facts revealing
the defenseless condition of this country and indicating
what must be done to avert national humiliation."</p></blockquote>


<p>"THIS POWERFUL BOOK HAS JARRED
AMERICAN COMPLACENCY AS NO
OTHER BOOK HAS EVER
DONE"</p>

<p>From The New York American</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the most remarkable men of our time has written
a book&mdash;and the book is probably the most startling document
ever placed before the American people. Its author is
Hudson Maxim, world-famous inventor, writer on many topics
of public interest, member of the Naval Advisory Board&mdash;and
an American patriot.</p>

<p>His book, called "Defenseless America," has fallen among
the complacent, the self-satisfied, the careless and the indifferent
like a seventeen-inch shell.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a pitiless book&mdash;pitiless in its facts, pitiless in its
logic, pitiless in its conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxim knows what he is writing about; he is one of
the greatest authorities on military affairs in the world.
His book has the cold steel precision of truth.</p>

<p>He shows that all wars have economic causes, no matter
how they are painted over with sentiment. And he demonstrates
that one of the most urgent economic incentives to
war that has ever existed will be the relative condition of
Europe and the United States at the close of the Great War.</p>

<p>Imagine the victors of this gigantic conflict&mdash;Allies or
Teutons&mdash;impoverished in money and resources, with the
most colossal public debt in the world's history hanging over
them, but possessing an enormous army of trained veterans
and a world-beating navy.</p>

<p>Then, on this side of the Atlantic, a nation that thinks it
"can whip all creation," and acts on that principle&mdash;a hundred
million over-fed, money-making people, nine-tenths of
whom could not load a modern infantry rifle if they should
ever happen to see one; a country of countless dollars protected
by obsolete battleships and submarines that can neither
float nor sink; a nation rich but undefended, confident but
weak, dictatorial in manner but powerless in action.</p>

<p>America sits on an open powder barrel. Will the Victors
of the Great War apply the match?</p>

<p>Get this stirring and tremendous book, and read what
will happen&mdash;in Mr. Maxim's own words. He will tell you
where the match will be applied, what points in controversy
will bring on the collision&mdash;and then what will take place
with startling swiftness.</p>

<p>And&mdash;</p>

<p>He tells what may be done, even at this late day, for
effective defense.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As Mr. Maxim has cut out all royalty, publishers are
thereby enabled to furnish a special edition of the book, of
which this volume is a sample, at only fifty cents a copy.</p>

<p>The book may be obtained of or ordered through any bookstore,
or the publishers, Hearst's International Library Company,
119 West 40th Street, New York, will send it postage-paid
to any address for sixty cents, or ten copies in a single
package for five dollars&mdash;fifty cents a copy. The library
edition, superior paper and binding, may still be had at two
dollars a copy.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
